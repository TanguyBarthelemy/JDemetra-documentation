The X-13ARIMA-SEATS method consists of two linked parts: the RegARIMA
model and the decomposition step that can be performed using the X-11
algorithm or the SEATS program. The results from the RegARIMA model,
which are displayed under the [Output from a modelling procedure](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html) section. 
The output from the decomposition step is presented in the three
nodes: [*Decomposition*](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html#decomposition), 
[*Benchmarking*](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html#benchmarking) 
and [*Diagnostics*](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html#diagnostic). 
The majority of indicators displayed in the *Diagnostics* are shared with TRAMO-SEATS. 
For the *Main results* node only one section is different from
the output produced by TRAMO-SEATS. This section focuses on the nodes
that are not handled elsewhere, i.e. the output produced by X-11.
Therefore the sections that are explained here are *Decomposition* and
some parts of the *Main results* and *Diagnostics* sections. Their
content is accessible once the user selects the appropriate node from
the left-hand side seasonal adjustment results panel.

**The structure of the results for X-13ARIMA-SEATS**

#### Main results

The first section of the *Main results* node summarises the results of
the pre-processing. The content of this panel depends on the
specifications used for processing and the results of the seasonal
adjustment[^35]. In the case of the pre-defined specifications X11,
RSA0, RSA1 and RSA3 no trading day effect is estimated. For RSA2c and
RSA4c pre-defined specifications, working day effects and the leap year
effect are pre-tested and estimated if present. If the working day
effect is significant, the pre-processing part includes the message
*Working days effects (1 variable)*. The message *Working days effects
(2 variables)* means that the leap year effect has also been estimated.
For RSA5c the trading day effect and the leap year effect are
pre-tested. If the trading day effect has been detected, either of the
messages *Trading days effects (6 variables)* or *Trading days effects
(7 variables)* are displayed, depending whether the leap year effect has
been detected or not. If the Easter effect is statistically significant,
*Easter effect detected* is displayed. In this section, only the total
number of detected outliers is visible. More detailed information on
each outlier, i.e. type, location and estimated coefficient, can be
found in the *Pre-processing* node.

**The summary of the results from RegARIMA**

The message *Series has been log-transformed* is only displayed if a
logarithmic transformation has been applied. Otherwise, the message does
not appear.

The [*m-statistics* section](../reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html#quality-measures) 
provides summary indicators (\\(q\\) and
\\(q - m2)\ \\)from analysis of M-statistics. The result displayed in green indicates
that the given indicator’s value has been accepted. When the indicator
is above one, the test fails and the statistic is displayed in red.

#### Decomposition (X11)

This part includes tables with results from consecutive iterations of
the X-11 algorithm and the set of quality measures.

##### **Tables**

The decomposition step of X-13ARIMA-SEATS is performed by an iterative
algorithm X-11, which general principle is an estimation of the
different components using the appropriate moving averages. The results
of each step of the algorithm are saved in the successive [tables](../theory/SA_X11.html#x-11-tables), which
are displayed in this section. However, some tables produced by the
original X-11 algorithm are omitted. The tables are divided into six
groups, which correspond to the main steps of the algorithm:

-   Part A: Pre-adjustments;

-   Part B: First automatic correction of the series;

-   Part C: Second automatic correction of the series;

-   Part D: Seasonal adjustment;

-   Part E: Components modified for large extreme values;

-   Part F: Seasonal adjustment quality measures.

As an example the view of the D-table group is presented below.

##### **Final filters**

The length of the seasonal and trend moving average filters used to
estimate the final seasonal factors and the final trend depend on the
time series and are [selected automatically](../theory/SA_lin.html#model-selection-criteria) by the X-11 algorithm on a
basis of the time series properties. In short, JDemetra+ selects the
filters automatically, taking into account the global moving seasonality
ratio, which is computed on preliminary estimates of the irregular
component and of the seasonal. In the case of user-defined seasonal adjustment specifications,
[the lengths of the seasonal and trend filters can be chosen manually](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#x11).

**Information about filters used by the X-11 algorithm to calculate the final estimate of the seasonal component and trend**

For user-defined specifications [the different seasonal filters can be
applied for each period](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#x11). In such case JDemetra+ informs
that the composite filter has been applied. The orders of seasonal
filters can be checked in the *Specification* panel in the *X11* **→**
*Details on seasonal filter* section.

##### **Quality measures**

The quality measures are tools that can be used to assess the quality of
the decomposition and determine the steps for improvement, if necessary.
The set of these measures includes 11 so called \\(M\\) statistics and
two synthetic measures: \\(Q\\) and \\(Q - M2.\\)

The \\(M\\) statistics are used to assess the quality of the seasonal
adjustment[^36]. These statistics vary between 0 and 3 but only values
smaller than 1 are acceptable. JDemetra+ displays their results together
with the composite indicators \\(Q\\) and \\(Q - M2.\\) Results
displayed in red indicate that the test failed.

{: .text-center.small}

**X-11 quality measures**

The details about the measures are given below.

-   \\(M1\\) measures the contribution of the irregular component to the
    total variance. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier
    correction should be considered.

-   \\(M2\\), which is a very similar to \\(M1\\), is calculated on the
    basis of the contribution of the irregular component to the
    stationary portion of the variance. When it is above 1, some changes
    in an outlier correction should be considered.

-   \\(M3\\) compares the irregular to the trend taken from a
    preliminary estimate of the seasonally adjusted series. If this
    ratio is too large, it is difficult to separate the two components
    from each other. When it is above 1 some changes in outlier
    correction should be considered.

-   \\(M4\\) tests the randomness of the irregular component. A value
    above 1 denotes a correlation in the irregular component. In such
    case a shorter seasonal moving average filter should be considered.

-   \\(M5\\) is used to compare the significance of changes in the trend
    with that in the irregular. When it is above 1 some changes in
    outlier correction should be considered.

-   \\(M6\\) checks the \\(\text{SI}\\) (seasonal – irregular components
    ratio). If annual changes in the irregular component are too small
    in relation to the annual changes in the seasonal component, the
    \\(3 \times 5\\) seasonal filter used for the estimation of the
    seasonal component is not flexible enough to follow the seasonal
    movement. In such case a longer seasonal moving average filter
    should be considered. It should be stressed that \\(M6\\) is
    calculated only if the \\(3 \times 5\\) filter has been applied in
    the model.

-   \\(M7\\) is the combined test for the presence of an identifiable
    seasonality. The test compares the relative contribution of stable
    and moving seasonality[^37].

-   \\(M8\\) to \\(M11\\) measure if the movements due to the short-term
    quasi-random variations and movements due to the long-term changes
    are not changing too much over the years. If the changes are too
    strong then the seasonal factors could be erroneous. In such case a
    correction for a seasonal break or the change of the seasonal filter
    should be considered.

The \\(Q\\) statistic is a composite indicator calculated from the
\\(M\\) statistics.

|     |                                                                                               |          |
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | \\[Q = \frac{10M1 + 11M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{100}\\] | \[1\]<!---\[5.25\]--> |

\\(Q = Q - M2\\) (also called \\(Q2\\)) is the \\(Q\\) statistic for
which the \\(M2\\) statistics was excluded from the formula, i.e.:

|     |                                                                                            |          |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | \\[Q - M2 = \frac{10M1 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 18M7 + 7M8 + 7M9 + 4M10 + 4M11}{89}\\] | \[2\]<!---\[5.26\]--> |

If a time series does not cover at least 6 years, the \\(M8\\),
\\(M9\\), \\(M10\\) and \\(M11\\) statistics cannot be calculated. In
this case the \\(Q\\) statistic is computed as:

|     |                                                                     |          |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | \\[Q = \frac{14M1 + 15M2 + 10M3 + 8M4 + 11M5 + 10M6 + 32M7}{100}\\] | \[3\]<!---\[5.27\]--> |

The model has a satisfactory quality if the \\(Q\\) statistic is lower
than 1.

The tables displayed in the *Quality measures **→** Details* node
correspond to the F-set of tables produced by the original X-11
algorithm. To facilitate the analysis of the results, the numbers and
the names of the tables are given under each table following the
convention used in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B. (1999).

The first table presents the average percent change without regard to
sign of the percent changes (multiplicative model) or average
differences (additive model) over several periods (from 1 to 12 for a
monthly series, from 1 to 4 for a quarterly series) for the following
series:

-   \\(O\\) – Original series (Table A1);

<!-- -->

-   \\(\text{CI}\\) – Final seasonally adjusted series (Table D11);

-   \\(I\\) – Final irregular component (Table D13);

-   \\(C\\) – Final trend (Table D12);

-   \\(S\\) – Final seasonal factors (Table D10);

-   \\(P\\) – Preliminary adjustment coefficients, i.e. regressors
    estimated by the RegARIMA model (Table A2);

-   \\(TD\& H\\) – Final calendar component (Tables A6 and A7);

-   \\(\text{Mod.O}\\) – Original series adjusted for extreme values
    (Table E1);

-   \\(\text{Mod.CI}\\) – Final seasonally adjusted series corrected for
    extreme values (Table E2);

-   \\(\text{Mod.I}\\) – Final irregular component adjusted for extreme
    values (Table E3).

In the case of an additive decomposition, for each component the average
absolute changes over several periods are calculated as[^38]:

$$
\text{Component}_{d} = \frac{1}{n - d}\sum_{t = d + 1}^{n}|Table_{t} - Table_{t - d}|
$$ \[4\]
 
where:

\\(d\\) – time lag in periods (from a monthly time series \\(d\\) varies
from to 4 or from 1 to 12);

\\(n\\) – total number of observations per period;

\\(\text{Component}\\) – the name of the component;

\\(\text{Table}\\) – the name of the table that corresponds to the
component.

**Table F2A – changes, in the absolute values, of the principal components**

Next, Table F2B of relative contributions of the different components to
the differences (additive model) or percent changes (multiplicative
model) in the original series is displayed. They express the relative
importance of the changes in each component. Assuming that the
components are independent, the following relation is valid:

|                                                                                           |          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| \\(O_{d}^{2} \approx C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}\\). | \[5\]<!---\[5.29\]--> |

In order to simplify the analysis, the approximation can be replaced by
the following equation:

|     |                                                                                      |          |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|     | \\(O_{d}^{*2} = C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + I_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2} + {TD\& H}_{d}^{2}\\). | \[6\]<!---\[5.30\]--> |

The notation is the same as for Table F2A. The column \\(\text{Total}\\)
denotes total changes in the raw time series.

Data presented in Table F2B indicate the relative contribution of each
component to the percent changes (differences) in the original series
over each span, and are calculated as:

\\(\frac{I_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}\\),   

\\(\frac{C_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}\\),

\\(\frac{S_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}\\), 

\\(\frac{P_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}\\)

and \\(\frac{TD\& H_{d}^{2}}{O_{d}^{*2}}\\)  

where:
\\(O_{d}^{*2} = I_{d}^{2} + C_{d}^{2} + S_{d}^{2} + P_{d}^{2}{+ TD\& H}_{d}^{2}\\).

The last column presents the *Ratio* calculated as:

\\(100 \times \frac{O_{d}^{*2}}{O_{d}^{2}}\\), 

which is an indicator of how well the approximation

 \\({(O_{d}^{*})}^{2} \approx O_{d}^{2}\\)
 
 
holds.

**Table F2B – relative contribution of components to changes in the raw series**

When an additive decomposition is used, Table F2C presents the average
and standard deviation of changes calculated for each time lag \\(d\\),
taking into consideration the sign of the changes of the raw series and
its components. In case of a multiplicative decomposition the respective
table shows the average percent differences and related standard
deviations.

**Table F2C – Averages and standard deviations of changes as a function of the time lag**

Average duration of run is an average number of consecutive monthly (or
quarterly) changes in the same direction (no change is counted as a
change in the same direction as the preceding change). JDemetra+
displays this indicator for the seasonally adjusted series, for the
trend and for the irregular component.

presented in Table F2E, are computed on a basis of the data in Table F2A.

**Table F2E – \\(\frac{\mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{C}}\mathbf{\ }\\)ratio for periods span**

The relative contribution of components to the variance of the
stationary part of the original series is calculated for the irregular
component (\\(I\\)), trend made stationary[^39] (\\(C\\)), seasonal
component (\\(S\\)) and calendar effects (TD&H). The short description
of the calculation method is given in LADIRAY, D., and QUENNEVILLE, B.
(1999).

**Table F2F – Relative contribution of components to the variance of the stationary part of the original series**

The last table shows the autocorrelogram of the irregular component from
Table D13. In the case of multiplicative decomposition it is calculated
for time lags between 1 and the number of periods per year +2 using the
formula[^40]:


$$\text{Corr}_{k}I = \frac{\sum_{t = k + 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)(I_{t - k} - 1)}}{\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{(I_{t} - 1)}^{2}}]$$ \[7\]<!---\[5.31\]-->

where \\(N\\) is number of observations in the time series and
\\(\text{k}\\) the lag.

**Table F2G – Autocorrelation of the irregular component**

The Cochran test is design to identify the heterogeneity of a series of
variances. X-13-ARIMA-SEATS uses this test in the extreme value
detection procedure to check if the irregular component is
heteroskedastic. In this procedure the standard errors of the irregular
component are used for an identification of extreme values. If the null
hypothesis that for all the periods (months, quarters) the variances of
the irregular component are identical is rejected, the standard errors
will be computed separately for each period (in case the option
*Calendarsigma*=**signif** has been selected).

**Cochran test**

For each \\(i^{\text{th}}\\) month we will be looking at the mean annual
changes for each component by calculating:

$$
{\overline{S}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}|S_{i,t} - S_{i,t - 1}|
$$

and

$$
{\overline{I}}_{i} = \frac{1}{N_{i} - 1}\sum_{t = 2}^{N_{i}}| I_{i,t} - I_{i,t - 1}|
$$,


where \\(N_{i}\\) refers to the number of months \\(\text{i}\\) in the
data, and the moving seasonality ratio of month \\(i\\):

$$MSR_{i} = \frac{\overline{I}_{i}}{\overline{S}_{i}}$$

These ratios are published in Table D9A in X13ARIMA-SEATS software. In
JDemetra+ they are presented in the details of the quality measures.

The [Moving Seasonality Ratio (MSR)](../theory/SA_X11.html#choosing-the-composite-moving-averages-when-estimating-the-seasonal-component) is used to measure the amount of
noise in the Seasonal-Irregular component. By studying these values, the
user can [select for each period the seasonal filter](../reference-manual/sa-spec-X13.html#seasonal-filter-x11-seasonalma) that is the most
suitable given the noisiness of the series.
