The *Likelihood* panel gives some insights into the results of the
estimation of the log-likelihood function. The chart represents the
opposite of the log-likelihood function. The maximum log-likelihood is
denoted by a red dot. The graph allows the user to study the parameters
of the ARIMA model estimated in the optimization procedure. As the graph
is three-dimensional, the graph is plotted for two chosen parameters.
The user can modify this choice with the options available on the right.
The menu offers additional options for adjusting a view.

**The example of the content of the *Likelihood* panel**

The settings for computation of the log-likelihood function can be
modified through the *Parameters* menu. TheÂ *Steps* parameter is the
number of values used for each parameter. The *Epsilon* parameter
defines the range used in the estimation of the parameter. In other
words, the likelihood function is computed, for each coefficient
\\(c_{i}\\) in the range
\\(\lbrack c_{i}\left( \max \right) - \text{epsilon};c_{i}\left( \max \right) + \text{epsilon}\rbrack\\),
for values separated by
\\(\frac{(2 \times \text{epsilon})}{(\text{steps} - 1)}\\). The value
\\(c_{i}\left( \max \right)\ \\)is the value of the coefficient
corresponding to the maximum likelihood.
