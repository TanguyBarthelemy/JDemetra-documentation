Examination of residuals from a fitted model for signs of model
inadequacy is a crucial step of a model validation. Therefore, JDemetra+
produces several residual diagnostics and graphs for a detailed
validation of the residuals. They are presented in the *Residuals*
section and its subcategories.

The main panel in this section shows residuals from the TRAMO model in
the graph and in the table. The graph can be used for visual examination
of the residuals. If the model is adequate, the residuals should not
contain any obvious, repetitive pattern.

The local menu, which is available for the graph, offers the copy and
export options, including sending the graph to the printer and saving
the graph as clipboard or as a file in the PNG format. The *Copy series*
option enables the user to select the series used to produce the graph
and export it to the another application.

**Residuals from the TRAMO model presented in a table**

A standard local menu, which is available for this table, includes:

-   **Select all** – copies series and allows it to be pasted into
    another application e.g. into Excel.

<!-- -->

-   **Transpose** – changes the orientation of the table from horizontal
    to vertical.

-   **Reverse chronology** – displays the series from last to first
    observation

-   **Single time series** – when it is marked observations are divided
    by calendar’s periods. Otherwise, data are presented as a standard
    time series.

<!-- -->

-   **Edit format** – allows changing the format used for displaying
    dates and values.

-   **Use color scheme** – allows series values to be displayed in
    colour.

-   **Color scheme** – allows for a choice of colour scheme from a
    pre-specified list.

-   **Show bars** – presents values in a table as horizontal bars.

-   **Zoom** – an option for modifying the chart size.

**Paste** and **Clear** are disabled as they are not relevant for this
view.

#### Statistics

The aim of the residuals’ diagnostic is to check if it can be assumed
that the residuals are random, normally distributed and do not contain
any structures that can be successfully modelled. JDemetra+ produces
various diagnostic statistics using the residuals from the TRAMO model
to scrutinize their properties.

For each test the corresponding p-value is reported. A p-value is the
probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one
that was actually observed. The results are marked in green, yellow or
red, depending on the result of statistical test used. Those in green
denote that the problematic characteristic has not been detected (e.g.
lack of normality of residuals, a significant autocorrelation in
residuals). An outcome in yellow denotes the uncertain results. An
outcome in red denotes cases where an issue should be addressed. Hence,
test statistics will indicate the need to improve the model. Ideally,
the model should be improved so that no test statistics indicate
uncertainties in the results.

The normality of residuals is crucial for the validity of the prediction
intervals produced in forecasting. To assess this property the
[Doornik-Hansen](../theory/Tests_DH.html) test is applied. To give more insight into the
outcome of this test also the closeness between the residuals mean,
skewness and kurtosis is tested. A significant value of one of these
statistics indicates that the standardized residuals do not follow a
standard normal distribution. The results shown below reveal that the
source of uncertain assessment of the normality is a poor skewness
performance.

**The results of normality of residuals tests**

The independence is assessed by the results of the [Ljung-Box
Q-statistics](../theory/Tests_LB.html) and the [Box-Pierce Q-statistics](../theory/Tests_BP.html) computed on the
regular and seasonal lags. These tests check for the presence of
autocorrelation between lags, which is a sign that the values of
residuals are not independent. The number of lags that are taken into
account depends on the time series frequency. The test on regular lags
examines the first 24 lags (for monthly series) or the first 16 lags
(for quarterly series). The tests for residual seasonal autocorrelation
in residuals consider the first two seasonal lags, irrespective of the
time series frequency.

Another test that checks for the presence of autocorrelation in the
residuals is the [Durbin–Watson statistic](../theory/Tests_DW.html). A test outcome that is close
to 2 indicates no sign of autocorrelation.

**The results of independence of tests on residuals**

The randomness in the signs of residuals is assessed by the
Wald-Wolfowitz test, also called the Run test. It examines the
hypothesis that a series of numbers is random. For data centred around
the mean, the test calculates the number and length of runs. A run is
defined as a set of sequential values that are either all above or all
below the mean. An up run is a sequence of numbers each of which is
above the mean; a down run is a sequence of numbers each of which is
below the mean.

The test checks if the up and down runs are distributed equally in time.
Both too many runs and too few runs are unlikely to be a real random
sequence. The null hypothesis is that the values of the series have been
independently drawn from the same distribution. The test also verifies
the hypothesis that the length of runs is random.

**The results of randomness of residuals tests**

The significant values of the Ljung-Box Q-statistics (or the Box-Pierce
Q-statistics) of the squared residuals indicate the random variation of
the coefficients or time-varying conditional variances. These effects
cannot be modelled by the TRAMO model. Their presences cause the test
statistics and forecast coverage intervals to have reduced reliability.
The autocorrelation is checked by JDemetra+ for the first 24 lags
(monthly series) or for the first 16 lags (quarterly series).

The example below shows the p-values marked in red, which indicate that
the null hypothesis (no autocorrelation) has been rejected. The outcome
of the linearity of the residuals test provides evidence of
autocorrelation in residuals, which means that the linear structure is
left in the residuals.

They include a sum of squares, a mean squared error (MSE) and a standard

**The detailed results of normality of residuals tests**

To assess the independence in detail, the [autocorrelation function](../theory/ACF_and_PACF.html)
of residuals with standard deviations, the Ljung-Box Q-statistics and
the Box-Pierce statistics are computed through each lag.

The presence of the autocorrelation at seasonal lags is checked by the
Ljung-Box Q-statistics and the Box-Pierce Q-statistics and the
respective p-values. They are accompanied by the autocorrelation
function of residuals and its standard deviations.

computed through each lag can be inspected to assess the presence of
residual autocorrelation structures.

#### Distribution

The sample [autocorrelation function (ACF) and sample partial
autocorrelation function (PACF)](../theory/ACF_and_PACF.html) of the (regularly and seasonally
differenced, if necessary) time series \\(y_{t}\\) are tools used in a
well-established procedure of an identification of an ARIMA model that
originates from the Box-Jenkins method. The significant lags observed
for those functions are signs of an autocorrelation or a moving average
processes present in the data. For an identification of the TRAMO models
a modified approach is needed, as described in BELL, W.R., and HILLMER,
S.C. (1984), since the presence of regression effects can distort the
appearance of the ACF and PACF.

As model residuals are expected to be a random process, the ACF and PACF
functions for residuals are expected not to contain any significant
values. The user is expected to examine these functions in the usual way
(check if the significant lags are present). 

The ACF and PACF graphs are accompanied by the picture that shows the
histogram of the residuals, which is compared with a normal
distribution. It is expected that the residuals follow the normal
distribution and therefore the consecutive histogram values should be
close to the relevant values of the normal distribution plot. The
significant lags, however, indicate the presence of an autocorrelation
structure left in the residuals.

#### Spectral analysis

In this section two spectral plots obtained for the residuals from the
TRAMO model are displayed. These graphs present two spectrum estimators
of the residuals: [periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html) and [autoregressive spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html)[^1]. They help
to reveal any seasonal and trading day effects remaining in the
residuals (see also [a scenerio that concerns these graphs](../case-studies/spectralgraphs.html)).


[^1]: The theoretical motivation for the choice of spectral estimator is
    provided by SOKUP, R., and FINDLEY, D. (1999).
