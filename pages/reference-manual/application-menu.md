The default JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the program, is clearly divided into several panels.

**JDemetra+ default view**

The key parts of the user interface are: 
* The [application menu](#application-menu).
* The [Providers](data-providers.html) window, which organises time series; 
* The [Workspace](workspace.html) window, which stores results generated by the software as well as settings used to create them; 
* A central empty zone for presenting the actual analyses further called the [Results](#results-panel) panel.


### Application menu {#application-menu}

The majority of functionalities are available from the main application menu, which is situated at the very top of the main window. If
the user moves the cursor to an entry in the main menu and clicks on the
left mouse button, a drop-down menu will appear. Clicking on an entry in
the drop-down menu selects the highlighted item.

### Results panel {#results-panel}
-------------

The blank zone in the figure above (on the right of the view) is the location where JDemetra+ displays various
windows. More than one window can be displayed at the same
time. Windows can overlap with each other with the foremost window being the one in
focus or active. The active window has a darkened title bar. [The windows
in the results panel can be arranged in many different ways](../reference-manual/window.html), depending
on the user’s needs. The example below shows one of the
possible views of this panel. The results of the user’s analysis are
displayed in an accompanying window. The picture below shows two panels
– a window containing seasonal adjustment results (upper panel) and
another one containing an autoregressive spectrum (lower panel).
