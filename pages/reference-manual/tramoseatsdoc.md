**The *TramoSeatsDoc* menu for a newly created X13 document**

*TramoSeatsDoc* is a default name that corresponds to the *TramoSeats*
document’s name. It is updated automatically, once the relevant
*TramoSeats* document is renamed.

The options for the *TramoSeatsDoc* include:

-   **Paste** – pastes the time series to the *TramoSeatsDoc* window and
    performs seasonal adjustment for this time series using settings
    selected for the current process. The series needs to be previously
    copied, e.g. from the *Providers* window. Otherwise the message
    informing that the action cannot be done is displayed.

-   **Refresh data** – updates the input data and executes the seasonal
    adjustment process. This option is only available for *TramoSeats*
    documents saved during a previous session with JDemetra+. To use
    this option, first create *TramoSeats* document and drag and drop
    the data into it. Then save the workspace and close JDemetra+. Next,
    update the time series (add/change the observations, but do not
    change either the localisation of the file or the file name) and
    open JDemetra+ once again. Open the previously saved workspace and
    double click on the respective *TramoSeats* document in the
    *Workspace* window. Finally, chose the **Refresh data** option from
    the *TramoSeatsDoc* menu. JDemetra+ re-estimates the complete
    seasonal adjustment model automatically, so the results are updated
    immediately. The user can modify the specification and validate the
    newly introduced changes using the *Specification* functionality
    (see [modelling specifications](modelling-specifications.html) and [seasonal adjustment specifications](sa-specifications.html)).
