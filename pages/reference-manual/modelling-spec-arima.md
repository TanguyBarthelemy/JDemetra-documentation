title: Options for the RegArima specifications
tagline: technical documentation for JDemetra+ using GitHub Pages
description: Basics
---

This section discusses the options available for the RegARIMA
specifications, which are based on the original X-13ARIMA-SEATS program
developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. 

The options available for the RegARIMA specifications are divided into five parts. These sections are: 
* [*Estimate*](#estimate);
* [*Transformation*](#transformation);
* [*Regression*](#regression);
* [*Outliers*](#outliers);
* [*Arima*](#arima).

The RegARIMA specifications are
to a very large extent organised according to the different
individual specifications of the original program and are presented in
the order in which they are displayed in the graphical interface of
JDemetra+.

**The RegARIMA specification sections**

To facilitate the comparison between JDemetra+ specifications and
specifications used in Win X-13, under each option the name of the
corresponding specification and argument from the original software is
given, if any. For an exact description of the different parameters, the
user should refer to the documentation of the original X-13ARIMA-SEATS
program[^30]. Some additional explanations about the RegARIMA model, its
parameters and estimation procedure are given [here](..\theory\SA_lin.html).

For the pre-defined specifications the parameters are fixed, but in the
case of the user-defined specification the user can set them
individually. However, as in some cases the choice of a given value
results in limitation of the possible alternatives for other parameters,
the user is not entirely free to set the values of the parameters. Most
arguments have default values; these are given in the documentation and
used unless changed by the user.

#### Estimate

The *Estimate* section specifies the details of estimation procedure of
the RegARIMA model determined in the [*Regression*](#regression) and [*Arima*](#arima) sections.

**RegARIMA specification -- options for the *Estimate* section**
 
* **Model span** $\rightarrow\ $**type**<br>
  *series {modelspan}*
    
	Specifies the span (data interval) of the time series     to be used for the estimation of the RegARIMA model coefficients. The RegARIMA model is then applied to the whole         series. With this argument the data early in the series can be prevented from affecting the forecasts, or,                alternatively, data later in the series are excluded from the modelling span, so that they do not influence the           regression estimates. The available parameter values are:
   * *All* -- full time series span is considered in the modelling;
   * *From* -- date of the first time series observation is included in the pre-processing model;
   * *To* -- date of the last time series observation is included in the pre-processing model;
   * *Between* -- dates of the first and the last time series observations are included in the pre-processing model;
   * *Last* -- a specific number of observations from the end of the time series is included in the pre-processing model;
   * *First* -- a specific number of observations from the beginning of the time series is included in the pre-processing      model;
   * *Excluding* -- a specific number of observations is excluded from the beginning (*first*) and/or end (*last*) of the      time series in the pre-processing model.

   With the options *Last*, *First*, *Excluding* the span can be computed dynamically on theseries. The default setting is    *All*.
 - **Tolerance**<br>*estimate {tol}*
 
     Convergence tolerance for the nonlinear estimation. The absolute changes in the log-likelihood function are compared to **Tolerance** to check for the convergence of the estimation iterations. The      default setting is 0.0000001.


#### Transformation

The *Transformation* section is used to transform the series prior to
estimating the RegARIMA model.

**RegARIMA specification -- options for the *Transformation* section**


 - **Function**<br>
   *transform {function=}* 
 
     Transformation of data. [^32] The user can choose between:
   * *None* -- no transformation of the data;
   * *Log* -- takes logs of the data;
   * *Auto* -- the program tests for the log-level specification. This option is recommended for automatic modelling of         many series.

   The default setting is *Auto*.
   
  - **AIC difference**<br> *transform {aicdiff=}* 
      
	  Defines the difference in AICC needed to accept no transformation over a log transformation when the automatic transformation selection option is invoked. The option is disabled when             **Function** is not set to *Auto*. The default *AIC difference* value is -2.
  - **Adjust**<br> *transform {adjust=}* 
  
    Options for proportional adjustment for the leap year effect. The option is available when **Function** is set to *Log*. **Adjust** can be set to:
    * *LeapYear* -- performs a leap year adjustment of monthly or quarterly data;
    * *LengthofPeriod* -- performs a length-of-month adjustment on monthly data or length-of-quarter adjustment on quarterly data; 
    * *None* -- does not include a correction for the length of the period.

    The default setting is *None*. 

#### Regression

The *Regression* section allows for estimating deterministic effects in
the series with the pre-defined regression variables. These variables
include [user-defined variables](user-defined-variables.html), several types of [pre-specified outliers](../case-studies/detailedsa-outliers.html),
intervention variables and [calendar effects](../case-studies/calendars-main.html). The pre-defined and
user-defined regression variables are selected with the **Variables**
argument.

**RegARIMA specification -- options for the *Regression* section**


 - **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **option**<br> *regression {variables = td1nolpyear, td, tdnoleapyear, td1coef}*
     
	 Specifies the type of calendar being assigned to the series. The following types of calendar    estimation are available:
    * *None* -- excludes calendar variables from the regression model.
    * *Default* -- means that a default JDemetra+ calendar, which does not include any country-specific holidays, will be used.
    * *Stock* -- estimates day-of-week effects for inventories and other stock reported for the $w^{\text{th}}$ day of the month (to denote the last day of the month enter 31).
    * *Holidays* -- corresponds to the pre-defined trading day variables, modified to take into account country specific  holidays. It means that after choosing this option the user should specify the type of the trading day effect (**Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **TradingDays**) and a previously defined calendar       that includes the country specific holidays (**Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $               **holidays**).
    * *UserDefined* -- used when the user wants to specify his own trading day variables. With this option calendar effects are captured only by regression variables chosen by the user from the [previously created list of user-defined variables](..\case-studies\detailedsa-calendarvariables.html).

    The default setting is *Default*.

    **The *option* menu**
	
 - **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **holidays**<br> *regression {variables=holiday}*
 
    A list of user-defined calendars to be used to create calendar regression variables. Option is available when **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **option** is set to *Holidays*.
	The user is expected to click the field to expand a list a previously defined calendars and choose an appropriate item.
	The default setting is *Default,* which implies that the default calendar is used and no country-specific holidays are 
	considered.

 - **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **userVariables**<br> *regression {variables=}*
    
	A list of predefined regression variables to be included in the model. Option is available when **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **option** is set to *UserDefined*.
    When the user chooses the *UserDefined* type for the trading day effect estimation, one must specify the corresponding    variables. It should be noted that [such variables must have been previously defined](..\case-studies\detailedsa-calendarvariables.html), otherwise the list in    the field **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **userVariables** is empty.
    The default setting is *Unsused.*

      **Assigning the user-defined variables to the RegArima model**
  
 - **Calendar** $\rightarrow \ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow \ $ **td**<br> *regression {variables=td}* 
 
    Assigns a type of  model-estimated regression effect to pre-specified regression variables. Option is available when **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **option** is set to *Default* or *Holidays*. Acceptable values:
    * *None* -- means that no calendar variables will be included in the regression.
    * *TradingDays* -- includes six day-of-the-week regression variables.
    * *WorkingDays* -- includes the working/non-working day contrast variable.

   The default setting is *TradingDays.*

   {: .text-center.small}

   **The *trading days* menu**   

 - **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **lp**<br> *regression {variables=lp}*
 
    Includes the leap-year effect in the model. Acceptable values:
    * *None* -- the leap-year effect is not included in the model;
    * *LeapYear* -- includes a contrast variable for the leap-year;
    * *LengthofPeriod* -- includes length-of-month (or length-of-quarter) as a regression variable to model the leap year     effect.

   The default setting is *LeapYear.* 
   
 - **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $ **autoAdjust** 
	    
    Option for an automatic correction for the leap year effect. It is available when in the **Transformation** section **function** is *Auto*. By default it is     enabled.     

 -  **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **tradingDays** $\rightarrow\ $**test**<br> *regression; aictest* 
 
    Pre-tests the significance of the trading day regression variables using the AICC statistics.
    The user can choose between the following options: 
    * *Add* -- the trading day variables are not included in the initial regression model but they can be added to the        RegARIMA model after the test.    
    * *None* -- the test is not performed; the specified calendar variables are used  in the model without pre-testing.
    * *Remove* -- the trading day variables belong to the initial regression model but they can be removed from the           RegARIMA model after the test.

    These options have no direct impact on the calendar tests themselves, but indirectly, through the definition of the       regression model, on any previous test. For instance, on rare occasions the log/level test could be affected by           add/remove on the trading day effect.
    The default setting is *Remove*. 

   {: .text-center.image-wrapper}

   ![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref_d25.jpg)

   {: .text-center.small}

   **The *test* menu**   

    
- **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **easter** $\rightarrow\ $ **IsEnabled**<br> *regression; variables and/or aictest* 
    
	The option enables the user to consider the Easter effect in the RegARIMA model. When the user ticks this option it means     that the correction for the Easter effect is considered. The inclusion of the Easter effect in the model depends on the   choice made in the *Pretest* section. Otherwise a correction for the Easter effect is not performed. 
- **Calendar** $\rightarrow \ $ **easter** $\mathbf{\rightarrow}$ **Use Julian Easter** 
    
	When marked, it enables Easter to be included, the date of which is derived from the Julian calendar and is converted to Gregorian calendar date. By default, the      checkbox is unmarked. 
- **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **easter** $\rightarrow\ $ **Pre-test**<br> *regression; aictest*
    
	Pre-tests the significance of the Easter regression variable using the AICC statistics. The user can choose between the following options:
  
  * *Add* -- the Easter effect is not included in the initial regression model but it can be added to the RegARIMA model    after the test.
  * *None* -- the Easter effect is not pre-tested. 
  * *Remove* -- the Easter effect belongs to the initial regression model and it can be removed from the RegARIMA model     after the test.    

  These options have no direct impact on the calendar tests themselves, but indirectly, through the definition of the       regression model, on any previous test. For instance, on rare occasions the log/level test could be affected by           add/remove on the Easter effect. 
  The default setting is *Add.*
- **Calendar** $\rightarrow \ $ **easter** $\rightarrow \ $ **Easter duration**<br> *regression {variables = easter\[w\]}*
   
   Duration (length in days) of the Easter effect. The length of the Easter effect can range from 1 to 20 days.[^33] The     *Easter duration* option is displayed when **Calendar** $\rightarrow\ $ **easter** $\rightarrow\ $ **Pre-test** is set   to either *None* or *Remove*. 
  The default value is 8.  
- **Pre-specified outliers**<br> *regression {variables = (ao tc ls so)}*
     
  User-defined outliers are used when prior knowledge suggests that certain effects exist at known time points.[^34] Four pre-defined outlier types, which are        simple forms of intervention variables, are implemented:
  * Additive Outlier (AO); 
  * Level shift (LS); 
  * Temporary change (TC)[^35]; 
  * Seasonal outliers (SO). 

  Descriptions and formulas are available in [Linearisation with the TRAMO and RegARIMA models](../theory/SA_lin.html).
  By default, no pre-specified outlier is included in the specification.
- **Intervention variables**<br> *regression {user=}*

    The intervention variables are defined as in TRAMO. Following the definition, these effects are special events known a priori (strikes, devaluations, political events, and so on). Intervention variables are modelled   as any possible sequence of ones and zeros, on which some operators may be applied. Intervention variables are built as  combinations of the following basic structures:[^36]
  * Dummy variables[^37];
  * Any possible sequence of ones and zeros;
  * $\frac{1}{(1 - \delta B)}$, $(0 < \delta \leq 1)$; 
  * $\frac{1}{(1 - \delta_{s}B^{s})}$, $(0 < \delta_{s} \leq 1)$;
  * $\frac{1}{(1 - B)(1 - B^{s})} $; where $B$ is a backshift operator (i.e. $B^{k}X_{t} = X_{t - k}$) and $s$ is frequency of the time series ($s = 12\ $for a monthly time series, $s = 4\ $for a quarterly time series). 
   
  These operations enable not only AO, LS, TC, SO and RP outliers to be generated, but also sophisticated intervention variables that are well-adjusted to the particular case. No intervention variables are included in the pre-defined        specifications. They can only be added to the user-defined specifications.Intervention variables are not implemented in    X-13ARIMA-SEATS, however they can be created by the user and introduced to the model as [user-defined variables](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html).
- **Ramp effects**<br> *regression {variables = (rp)}*

   A ramp effect means a linear increase or decrease in the level of the series over a specified time interval $t_{0}$ to $\ t_{1}$. All dates of the ramps must occur within the time series span. Ramps can overlap other ramps, additive outliers and level shifts. The graph and formula are available in [Linearisation with the TRAMO and RegARIMA models](../theory/SA_lin.html).
   No ramps are included in the pre-defined specifications. They can only be added to the user-defined specifications.

   **Defining the Ramp effects**
  
- **User-defined variables**<br> *regression {user=}*

    The user-defined variable is an external regressor included by the user in the RegARIMA model. To add a user-defined variable to the model, one must specify the corresponding variable in   the *Variables* window. First, click the *Unnamed* item and then click the *Name* field to expand a list of available     variables and choose a variable from the list. It should be noted that such variables must have been previously defined (see instructions provided [here](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html)), otherwise the list is empty. 
	
	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

    ![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref_d17.jpg)

    {: .text-center.small}

    **Defining the user-defined variable**
	
	The user-defined regression variable associated to a specific component should not contain effects that have to be associated with another component. Therefore, the following rules should be obeyed:
  * The variable assigned to the trend or to the seasonally adjusted series should not contain a seasonal pattern; 
  * The variable assigned to the seasonal should contain neither a trend nor a level (i.e. should have a zero mean); 
  * The variable assigned to the irregular should contain neither a seasonal pattern nor a trend (i.e. should have a zero mean); 

   The user-defined variables should cover the period of the dependent series and the appropriate number of forecasts. For    the other periods the variables are implicitly set to 0. If the forecasts are not provided, it will not alter the results of the seasonal adjustment but the forecasts of the final components will be unusable.
   The effect of the user-defined variable can be assigned to the:
   * *Series*;
   * *Trend*;
   * *Irregular component*;
   * *Seasonal component*;
   * *Seasonally adjusted series*;
   * *Series*;
   * *Undefined* (a default setting), which implies that the effect is an additional component [^38]. With this option the regression variable is used to improve the modelling, but it is not removed from the series for the decomposition[^41].

 
   The calendar component is not available in this section. Therefore, a user-defined variable assigned to the calendar 
   effect should be added in the calendar part of the specification. 
   For the user-defined variable the structure of the lags can be specified using the options *first lag* and *last lag*[^40]. When the regression variable $x_{t}$ is introduced with *first lag* = and *last lag* =, JDemetra+ includes     in the TRAMO model a set of variables $x_{t - l_{a}}$,...,$\ x_{t - l_{ b}}$ and estimates the respective regression coefficients called the impulse response weights. 
   To include only the first lag ($x_{t - 1})\ $ of the user-defined variable ($x_{t})\ $in the RegARIMA model the user      should put *first lag* = *last lag* = 1. If for a monthly series one puts *first lag* = 0 and *last lag* = 11, it means    that in addition to instantaneous effect of the user-defined variable, also the effects of 11 lagged explanatory          variables are included in the model. In this case the set of estimated coefficients, called a transfer function,          describe how the changes in $x_{t}$ that took place over a year are transferred to the dependent variable. However, the    lagged variables are often collinear so that caution is needed in attributing much meaning to each coefficient[^39].
   No user-defined variables are included in the pre-defined specifications. They can only be added to the user-defined      specifications.
   
- **Fixed regression coefficients**<br> *estimate; fix*

  For the pre-specified regression variables this option specifies the parameter estimates that will be held fixed at the values provided by the user.
  To fix a coefficient the user should undertake the following actions:
  * Choose the transformation (log or none). 
  * Define some regression variables in the *Regression* section.
  * Push on the fixed regression coefficients editor button in the *User-defined variables* row.
  * Select the regression variable from the list for which the coefficient will be fixed.
  * Save the new settings with the **Done** button.

    **Fixing the coefficient of the user-defined variable**
   
#### Outliers

The *Outliers* section enables the user to perform an automatic
detection of additive outliers, temporary change outliers, level shifts,
seasonal outliers, or any combination of the four, using the specified
model.

**RegARIMA specification -- options for the *Outliers* section**

- **Is enabled**<br> *outlier; --*

   Enables/disables the automatic detection of outliers in the span determined by the  **Detection span** option. By default, the checkbox is marked, which implies that the automatic identification of         outliers is enabled. 
- **Detection span** $\rightarrow\ $ **type**, *outlier; span* 

  A span of the time series to be searched for outliers. The available parameter's values are: 
  * *All* -- full time series span is considered in the modelling;
  * *From* -- date of the first time series observation included in the pre-processing model;
  * *To* -- date of the last time series observation included in the pre-processing model;
  * *Between* -- date of the first and the last time series observations included in the pre-processing model;
  * *Last* -- number of observations from the end of the time series included in the pre-processing model; 
  * *First* -- number of observations from the beginning of the time series included in the pre-processing model;
  * *Excluding* -- number of observations excluded from the beginning (specified in the *First* field) and/or end           (specified in the *Last* field) of the time series in the pre-processing model.

   With the options *Last*, *First*, *Excluding* the span can be computed dynamically on the series. The default setting     is *All*.
- **Use default critical value**<br> *outlier; critical* 
   
   The critical value is automatically determined by the number of observations in the interval specified by the **Detection span** option. When **Use default critical value** is           disabled, the procedure uses the critical value inputted in the **Critical value** item (see below). Otherwise, the  default value is used (the first case corresponds to **Critical value** = \"*xxx*\"; the second corresponds to a          specification without the critical argument). It should be noted that it is not possible to define a separate critical    value for each outlier type.
   By default, the checkbox is marked, which implies that the automatic determination of the critical value is enabled.  
- **Critical value**<br> *outlier; critical*
    
	The critical value used in the outliers' detection procedure. The option is active once **Use default critical value** is disabled. By default, it is set to 4.0.
- **Additive**<br> *outlier; ao*
    
	Automatic identification of additive outliers. By default, this option is enabled.
- **Level shift**<br> *outlier; ls*
    
	Automatic identification of level shifts. By default, this option is enabled.
- **Transitory change**<br> *outlier; tc*
    
	Automatic identification of transitory changes. By default, this option is enabled.
- **Seasonal outlier**<br> *outlier;*
    
	Automatic identification of seasonal outliers. By default, this option is disabled.
- **TC rate**, *outlier; tcrate*
    
	The rate of decay for the transitory change outlier. It must be a number greater than zero and less than one. The default value is 0.7.
- **Method**<br> *outlier; method*
    
	Determines how the program successively adds detected outliers to the model. At present only one method, namely *AddOne* is supported. Using this approach JDemetra+ calculates t-statistics for each type of     outlier specified (AO, TC and/or LS) at all time points, for which outlier detection is being performed. If the maximum   absolute outlier t-statistic exceeds the critical value, then an outlier has been detected and the appropriate            regression variable is added to the model.  
    The program then estimates the new model (the old model with the detected outlier added) and searches for an additional   outlier. This process is repeated until no additional outliers are found. At this point, a backward deletion process is   used to delete outliers, for which the absolute t-statistics no longer exceed the critical value, from the model. This    is done one at a time beginning with the least significant outlier, until all outliers remaining in the model are         significant. During backward deletion the usual (non-robust) residual variance estimate is used, which can yield          somewhat different outlier t-statistics from those obtained during outlier detection. 

#### Arima

An identification of the ARIMA part of the RegARIMA model can be done
either in an automatic way or by the user who specifies the appropriate
parameters. This choice is controlled by the **Automatic** option and
results in a list of parameters dedicated for chosen ARIMA
identification procedure. When the **Automatic** option is marked, the
order of the ARIMA model results from the automatic identification
procedure selects the final structure of the ARIMA model. The maximum
orders of the regular polynomials are 3, and the maximum orders of
seasonal polynomials are 1. The parameters available for automatic model
identification are presented below.

#### **RegARIMA specification - options for the automatic identification of the *ARIMA* model**


- **Automatic**<br> *automdl; --* 
   
   When marked it enables automatic modelling of the ARIMA model to be performed.

- **Accept Default**<br> *automdl; acceptdefault* 
    
	Controls whether the default model (ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)) is chosen if the [Ljung-Box Q-statistics](../theory/Tests_LB.html) for these model residuals is acceptable. If the default model is found to be acceptable, no        further attempt will be made to identify a model or differencing order. By default, the **Accept Default** checkbox is    unmarked.
- **Cancelation limit**<br> *automdl; --* 
    
	[Cancellation limit for the AR and the MA roots to be assumed equal](../theory/SA_lin.html#cancellation-of-ar-and-ma-factors). This      option is mainly used in the automatic identification of the differencing order. The default parameter value is 0.1.
- **Initial UR (Diff.)**<br> *automdl; --* 
    
	The threshold value for the initial unit root[^52] test in the automatic identification of differencing order procedure. When one of the roots in the estimation of the (2,0,0)(1,0,0) plus mean   model, which is performed in the first step of the automatic model identification procedure, is larger than **First unit   root limit**, in modulus, it is set equal to unity.
    The default parameter value is 1.0416666666666667.
- **Final UR (Diff.)**<br> *automdl; --* 
    
	The threshold value for the final unit root test in the automatic identification of differencing order procedure. When one of the roots in the estimation of the (1,0,1)(1,0,1) plus mean model, which is   performed in the second step of the automatic model identification procedure, is larger than **Final unit root limit**,   in modulus, it is checked if there is a common factor in the corresponding AR and MA polynomials of the ARMA model that   can be cancelled (see **Cancelation limit**)). If there is no cancellation, AR root it is set equal to unity (i.e. the    differencing order increases).
    The value of **Final unit root limit** should be smaller than one. The default parameter value is 0.88.
- **Mixed**<br> *automdl; mixed*
   
   Controls whether ARIMA models with non-seasonal AR and MA terms or seasonal AR and MA terms will be considered in the automatic model identification procedure. When this option is disabled, a model with AR   and MA terms in both the seasonal and non-seasonal parts of the model can be acceptable, provided there are not AR and    MA terms in either the seasonal or non-seasonal.
- **Balanced**<br> *automdl; balanced*  
    
	Controls whether the automatic model procedure will have a preference for balanced models (i.e. models for which the order of the combined AR and differencing operator is equal to the order of the         combined MA operator[^53]). By default, the **Balanced** checkbox is unmarked. When it is marked, the same preference    as for the TRAMO program is used.
- **ArmaLimit**<br> *automdl; armalimit* 
    
	The threshold value for t-statistics of ARMA coefficients used for the final test of [a model parsimony](../theory/SA_lin.html#automatic-model-identification-procedure-in-tramo). If the highest order of the ARMA coefficient has a t-value less than this value in magnitude,    JDemetra+ will reduce the order of the model. The value given for **ArmaLimit** is also used for the final check for the   significance of the constant term; if the constant term has a t-value less than **ArmaLimit** in magnitude, the program   will remove the constant term from the set of regressors. The **ArmaLimit** value should be greater than zero. The        default parameter value is 1.
- **Reduce CV**<br> *automdl; reducecv* 
    
	The percentage by which the outlier critical value will be reduced when the preferred model is found to have [the Ljung-Box Q-statistic](../theory/Tests_LB.html) with an unacceptable confidence coefficient. The parameter   should be between 0 and 1, and will only be active when automatic outlier identification is selected. The reduced         critical value will be set to (1-**ReduceCV**)×CV, where CV is the original critical value. The default parameter value   is 0.14268.
- **LjungBox limit**<br> *automdl; ljungboxlimit* 
    
	Acceptance criterion for the confidence intervals of [the Ljung-Box Q-statistic](../theory/Tests_LB.html). If the Ljung-Box Q-statistic for the residuals of a final model (checked at lag 24 if the series is    monthly, 16 if the series is quarterly) is greater than **LjungBox limit**, the model is rejected, the outlier critical   value is reduced, and model and outlier identification (if specified) is redone with a reduced value (see **Reduce CV**  argument). The default parameter value is 0.95.
- **Unit root limit**<br> *automdl; urfinal* 

    The threshold value for the final unit root test. If the magnitude of an AR root for the final model is less than this number, a unit root is assumed, the order of the AR polynomial is reduced by   one, and the appropriate order of the differencing (non-seasonal, seasonal) is increased. The parameter value should be   greater than one. The default parameter value is 1.05.

When the **Automatic** checkbox in the **Arima** section is unmarked,
JDemetra+ allows the user to specify the structure of the ARIMA part of
the RegARIMA model. Initial values for the individual AR and MA
parameters can be specified for the iterative estimation. Also,
individual parameters can be held fixed at these initial values while
the rest of the parameters are estimated. The options available here
correspond to the original X-13ARIMA-SEATS **arima** spec with some
limitations. JDemetra+ does not allow for operators with missing lags.
Also the maximum lag is reduced in comparison with Win X-13.

**A checkbox for switching bewteen manual and automiatic choice of teh Arima model**

JDemetra+ allows the user to fix individual parameters of the ARIMA
model at initial values while the rest of the parameters are estimated.
However, users should not specify initial values for the MA (moving
average) parameters that yield the MA polynomial with the roots inside
the unit circle. It is also allowed, e.g. for the iterative estimation,
to specify the initial values for the individual AR (autoregressive) and
MA parameters.

[^31]: The test for log-level specification used by TRAMO/SEATS is based
    on the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameter $\lambda$ in
    the Box-Cox transformations (which is a power transformations such
    that the transformed values of the time series $\text{y\ }$are a
    monotonic function of the observations, i.e.
    $y_{i}^{\alpha} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
    \frac{y_{i}^{\alpha} - 1}{\lambda},\ \lambda \neq 0 \\
    \log y_{i}^{\alpha},\ \lambda = 0 \\
    \end{matrix} \right.\ $. The program first fits two Airline models
    (i.e. ARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1)) to the time series: one in logs
    ($\lambda = 0$), other without logs ($\lambda = 1$). The test
    compares the sum of squares of the model without logs with the sum
    of squares multiplied by the square of the geometric mean in the
    case of the model in logs. Logs are taken in the case this last
    function is the maximum, GÓMEZ, V., and MARAVALL, A. (2009).

    effect can range from 1 to 25 days.

[^37]: Dummy variable is the variable that takes the values 0 or 1 to
    indicate the absence or presence of some effect.

[^38]: The convention for assigning effects for user-defined regressors
    is based on the TRAMO/SEATS solution. The original X-12-ARIMA
    program does not provide the same functionality. The effect of
    additional component (option \"Undefined\") is a special feature
    introduced in the original X-12-ARIMA program and not available in
    TRAMO/SEATS.

[^39]: A typical example could be a variable that measures the weather
    conditions: introducing them could improve the linearization;
    however, these effects are not allocated to a specific component. On
    the contrary, the impact of this variable will be split between all
    components.
