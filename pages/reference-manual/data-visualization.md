	**Full local menu options**

1.  These additional options include the *Open with* option, which opens
    time series in a separate window according to the user choice (chart
    & grid or only chart). *All ts views* option is not available at the
    moment. The picture below shows the view displayed once *Chart &
    grid* option was chosen. By clicking on the marked buttons the user
    can switch between chart and grid view. For both views (chart and
    grid) the local menu is available.

	**Renaming a time series**

1.  The option *Split into the yearly components* opens an additional
    window that presents the analysed series data split by year. This
    chart is useful to investigate the differences in time series values
    caused by the seasonal factors. The graph gives some idea about the
    existence and size of deterministic and stochastic seasonality in
    data.
