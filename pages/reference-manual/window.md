The *Window* menu offers several functions that facilitate the analysis
of data and enables the user to adjust the interface view to the user’s
needs.

**The *Window* menu**

-   **Preview Time Series** – opens a window that plots any of the
    series the user selects from *Providers*.

-   **Debug** – opens a *Preview Time Series* window that enables a
    fast display of the graphs for time series from a large dataset. To
    display the graph click on the series in the *Providers* window.

-   [**Providers**](../reference-manual/data-providers.html) – opens (if closed) and activates the *Providers*
    window.

-   [**Variables**](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html) – opens (if closed) and activates the *Variable*
    window.

-   [**Workspace**](../reference-manual/workspace.html) – opens (if closed) and activates the *Workspace*
    window.

-   **Output** – a generic window to display outputs in the form of text;
    useful with certain plug-ins (e.g. tutorial descriptive statistics).

-   **Editor** – activates the editor panel (and update the main menu
    consequently).

-   **Configure Window** – enables the user to change the way that the window is displayed
     (maximise, float, float group, minimise, minimise group).
    This option is active when some window is displayed in the JD+
    interface.

-   **Properties** – opens the *Properties* window and displays the
    properties of the marked item (e.g. time series, data source).

-   **Reset Windows** – restores the default JDemetra+ view.

-   **Close Window** – closes all windows that are open.

-   **Close All Documents** – closes all documents that are open.

-   **Close Other Documents** – closes all documents that are open
    except for the one that is active (which is the last activated one).

-   **Document Groups** – enables the user to create and manage the
    document groups.

-   **Documents** – lists all documents that are active.
