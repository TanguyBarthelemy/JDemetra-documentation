The Tools menu includes, among other functionalities, tools that are helpful for the graphical analysis of a time series. The [*‘X-13ARIMA-SEATS Reference Manual’ (2015)*](https://www.census.gov/ts/x13as/docX13ASHTML.pdf) 
strongly recommends studying a high resolution plot of the time series as it is helpful to gain insight on issues, such as, 
seasonal patterns, potential outliers and stochastic non-stationarity. Also the *‘ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment’ (2015)* recommends carrying out a graphical analysis on both unadjusted data and 
the initial run of the seasonal adjustment. Graphical analysis should consider: 
* The length of the series and the model span;  
* The presence of zeros, outliers or problems in the data;  
* The structure of the series: presence of; long term and cyclical movements, seasonal components, volatility etc.;  
* The presence of possible breaks in the seasonal behaviour;  
* The decomposition scheme (additive, multiplicative).


The [*‘ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment’ (2015)*](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3), 
recommend that this exercise should be performed and documented for the most important series to be adjusted at least once a year.
The following functionalities are available from the *Tools* menu:

* [*Container*](#container) – includes several tools for displaying data in a time domain;
* [*Spectral analysis*](#spectral-analysis) – contains tools for the analysis of a time series in a frequency domain;
* [*Aggregation*](#aggregation) – enables the user to investigate a graph of the sum of multiple time series;
* [*Differencing*](#differencing) – allows for the inspection of the first regular differences of the time series;
* [*Spreadsheet profiler*](#spreadsheet profiler) – offers an Excel-type view of the XLS file imported to JDemetra+.
* [*Plugins*](#plugins) – allows for the installation and activation of plugins, which extend JDemetra+ functionalities.
* [*Options*](#options) – presents the default interface settings and allows for their modification.

**The *Container* menu**

Several containers 
can be opened at the same time. Each of them may include multiple time 
series.  

*Chart* plots the time series as a graph. This function opens an empty
window. To display a given series drag and drop the series from the
*Providers* window into the empty window. More than one series can be displayed on one
graph. The chart is automatically rescaled after adding a new series.

{: .text-center.small}

**Local menu options for the *Grid* view**

The options available in *Grid* are:

-   **Transpose** – changes the orientation of the table from horizontal
    to vertical.

-   **Reverse chronology** – displays the series from the last to the
    first observation.

-   **Single time series** – removes from the table all time series
    apart from the selected one.

-   **Use color scheme** – allows the series to be displayed in colour.

-   **Show bars** – presents values in a table as horizontal bars.

-   **Show crosshair** – highlights an active cell.

-   **Zoom** – option for modifying the chart size.


When none of the series is selected, the local menu offers a reduced
list of options. The explanation of the other options can be found below in the '*Local menu options for chart*' 
figure in the [*Container*](#container) section.

**A reduced list of options for *Grid***

The *Growth chart* tab opens an empty window. Once a given series is dropped
into it, *Growth chart* presents the year-over-year or period-over-period
growth rates for the selected time series. More than one series can be
displayed in a table. The growth chart is automatically rescaled after
adding a new series.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref33.jpg)

{: .text-center.small}

**The *Growth chart* view with a local menu**

A left click displays a local menu with the available options. Those that
are characteristic for the *Growth chart* are:

-   **Kind** – displays m/m (or q/q) and y/y growth rates for all time
    series in the chart (previous period and previous year options
    respectively). By default, the period-over-period growth rates are
    shown.

-   **Edit last year** – for clarity and readability purposes, only five
    of the last years of observations are shown by default. This setting can be
    adjusted in the [*Options*](#options) section, if required.

The explanation of other options can be found below in the '*Local menu options for chart*' figure in the [*Container*](#container) section.

The *List* tab tprovides basic information about the chosen time series, such as; the
start and end date, the number of observations and a sketch of the data
graph. This function opens an empty window. To display information, drag
and drop the series from the [*Providers*](../reference-manual/data-providers.html) window into the *List* window.
A right click displays the local menu with all available options. Apart
from the standard options, the local menu for *List* enables marking the
series that match the selected frequency (yearly, half-yearly,
quarterly, monthly) by using the *Select by frequency* option. An
explanation of other options can be found below in the '*Local menu options for chart*' figure in the [*Container*](#container) section.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

**A view of a list of series**

For a selected series a local menu offers an extended list of options.
The explanation of the functions available for the local menu is given
below in the '*Local menu options for chart*' figure in the [*Container*](#container) section.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref35.jpg) 

{: .text-center.small}

**Options available for a selected series from the list**

### Spectral analysis {#spectral-analysis}

The *Spectral analysis* section provides three spectral graphs that allows an
in-depth analysis of a time series in the frequency domain. These graphs
are the *Auto-regressive Spectrum*, the *Periodogram* and the *Tukey Spectrum*.
For more information the user may study [a basic desription of spectral analysis](../theory/spectral.html)
and [a detailed presentation of the abovementioned tools](../case-studies/spectralgraphs.html).

**Tools for spectral analysis**

### Aggregation {#aggregation}

*Aggregation* calculates the sum of the selected series and provides
basic information about the selected time series, including the start
and end date, the number of observations and a sketch of the data graph, in
the same way as in the *List* functionality. *Aggregation* opens an empty
window. To sum the selected series, drag and drop them from the
*Providers* window into the *Aggregation* window. Right click displays
the local menu with the available options. The content of the local menu
depends on the panel chosen (the panel on the left that contains the list
of the series and the panel on the right that presents the graph of an
aggregate). The local menu for the list of series offers the option
*Select by frequency*, which marks all the series on the list that are
yearly, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly (depending on the user’s
choice). The explanation of the other options can be found below in the '*Local menu options for chart*' 
figure in the [*Container*](#container) section. The local menu for the panel on the left offers functionalities
that are analogous to the ones that are available for the *List*
functionalities, while the options available for the local menu in the
panel on the left are the same as the ones available in *Chart* (see
[*Container*](#container)).

{: .text-center.small}

**The *Aggregation* tool**

### Differencing {#differencing}

The *Differencing* window displays the first regular differences for
the selected time series together with the corresponding periodogram and the
PACF function. By default, the window presents the results for
non-seasonally and seasonally differenced series
\\(\left( d = 1,D = 1 \right)\\). These settings can be changed through
the *Properties* window (*Tools* *→ Properties*). A description of a
periodogram and the PACF function can be found [here](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html).

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref38.jpg)

{: .text-center.small}

**The properties of the *Differencing* tool**

The typical results are shown below. The bottom left graph presents the
partial autocorrelation coefficients (vertical bars) and the confidence
intervals. The right-click local menu offers several functionalities for
a differenced series. An explanation of the available options can be found
below in the "*Local menu options for chart*" figure in the [*Container*](#container) section.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref39.jpg)

{: .text-center.small}

**The *Differencing* tool**

For the *Partial autocorrelation* and the *Periodogram* panels the
right-button menu offers "a copy series" option that allows data to be
exported to another application and a graph to be printed and saved
to a clipboard or as a jpg file. Information about the partial
autocorrelation function is given [here](../theory/ACF_and_PACF.html). The description of a
periodogram is presented in [the Spectral graphs scenario](/case-studies/spectralgraphs.html).

### Spreadsheet profiler {#spreadsheet-profiler}

The *Spreadsheet profiler* offers an Excel-type view of the XLS file
imported to JDemetra+. To use this functionality drag the file name from
the *Providers* window and drop it to the empty *Spreadsheet profiler*
window.

**The *Spreadsheet Profiler* window**

### Plugins {#plugins}

JDemetra+ is an application that supports plug-ins. A plugin is a
software component that adds a specific feature to the existing software
application and is independent from the software version. It allows an
application to be enhanced without changing the original code. Plugins
can be shared between the users and installed individually. In this way
new functionalities can be easily distributed among seasonal adjustment
community members.

The *Plugins* window includes five panels: *Updates*, *Available
plugins*, *Downloaded*, *Installed* and *Settings*, some of them however
are not operational in the current version of the software.

* The *Updates* panel offers the user the option to manually check if
some updates of the already installed plugins are available. This
functionality, however, is currently not operational for the JDemetra+
plugins.
* The *Available plugins* panel allows the downloading of all plugins that
are related to JDemetra+. This functionality, however, is currently not
operational for the JDemetra+ plugins.
* The *Downloaded* panel is designed for the installation of new plugins
from a local machine. This process in explained in more detail below.
* The *Settings* panel is designated for adding update centres, which
are the locations that hold plugins. For each centre the user can specify
proxy settings and a time interval to automatically check for any
updates. At the moment this functionality is not operational for the
JDemetra+ plugins.

Installation of the new plugins from the local machine can be done from
the *Plugin* functionality activated from the *Tools* menu.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

### Options {#options}

The *Options* window includes five main panels: *Demetra*, *General*,
*Keymap*, *Appearance* and *Miscellaneous*. They are visible in the very
top of the *Options* window.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref41.jpg)

{: .text-center.small}

**The main sections of the *Options* window**

By default, the *Demetra* tab is shown. It is divided into seven panels:
*Behaviour*, *Demetra UI*, *Statistics*, *Data transfer*, *Demetra
Paths*, *ProcDocumentItems*, and *Interchange*.

*Behaviour* defines the default reaction of JDemetra+ to some of the
actions performed by the user.

-   **Providers** – an option to show only the data providers that are
    currently available.

-   **Persistence** – an option to restore the data sources after
    re-starting the application so that there is no need to fetch them
    again (**Persist opened DataSources**) and an option to restore all
    the content of the chart and grid tools (**Persist tools content**).

-   **Threading** – defines how resources are allocated to the
    computation (**Batch Pool Size** controls the number of cores used
    in parallel computation and **Batch Priority** defines the priority
    of computation over other processes). Changing these values might
    improve computation speed but also reduce user interface
    responsiveness.

-   **Time Series** – determines the default behaviour of the program
    when the user double clicks on the data. It may be useful to plot
    the data, visualise it on a grid, or to perform any pre-specified
    action, e.g. execute a seasonal adjustment procedure.

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref42.jpg)

{: .text-center.small}

**The content of the *Behavior* tab**

The *Demetra UI* tab enables the setting of:

-   a default colour scheme for the graphs (**Color scheme**).

-   the data format (uses MS Excel conventions). For example,
    \#\#\#,\#\#\#.\#\#\#\# implies the numbers in the tables and the
    y-axis of the graphs will be rounded up to four decimals after the decimal
    point (**Data format**).

-   the default number of last years of the time series displayed in charts
    representing growth rates (**Growth rates**).

-   the control of the view of the window for adding pre-specified outliers.
    (**Pre-specified Outliers**)

-   the visibility of the icons in the context menus (**Context Menus**).

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

![Text](/assets/img/reference-manual/manual/A_Ref43.jpg)

{: .text-center.small}

**The content of the *Demetra UI* tab**

The *Statistics* tab includes options to control:

-   The number of years used for spectral analysis and for model
    stability (**Default Number of Last Years**);

-   The default pre-defined specification for seasonal adjustment
    (**Seasonal Adjustment**);

-   The type of the analysis of revision history (**Revision History**):

    -   *FreeParameters* – the RegARIMA model parameters and regression
        coefficients of the RegARIMA model will be re-estimated each
        time the end point of the data is changed. This argument is
        ignored if no RegARIMA model is fit to the series.

    -   *Complete* – the whole RegARIMA model together with regressors
        will be re-identified and re-estimated each time the end point
        of the data is changed. This argument is ignored if no RegARIMA
        model is fitted to the series.

    -   *None* – the ARIMA parameters and regression coefficients of the
        RegARIMA model will be fixed throughout the analysis at the
        values estimated from the entire series (or model span).

-   The settings for the quality measures and tests used in a diagnostic
    procedure:

    -   **Default components** – a list of series and diagnostics that
        are displayed in the **SAProcessing** \\(\rightarrow\\)
        **Output** window. The list of default items can be modified
        with the respective **Select** button (see figure below)
    -   **Diagnostics** – a list of diagnostics tests, where the
        user can modify the default settings (see figure "*The panel for modification of the settings for the tests in the Basic checks section*" below).

{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

**The *Default components* section on the *Statistics* tab**

An explanation of the list of the series and diagnostics components that are
displayed in the *Default components* section can be found [here](../theory/output.html).

To modify the settings for a particular measure, double click on a
selected row (select the test’s name from the list and click on the
working tools button), introduce changes in the pop-up window and click
OK.

To reset the default settings for a given test, select this test from
the list and click on the backspace button situated below the working
tools button. The description of the parameters for each quality measure
and test used in a diagnostic procedure can be found in 7.12.

*ProcDocumentItems* includes a list of all reports available for processed
documents like seasonal adjustment. The *Interchange* tab lists the
protocols that can be used to export/import information like calendars,
specifications, etc. For the time being, the user cannot customize the
way the standard exchanges are done. However, such features could be
implemented in plug-ins.

The next section, *General*, allows for the customisation of the proxy
settings. A proxy is an intermediate server that allows an application
to access the Internet. It is typically used inside a corporate network
where Internet access is restricted. In JDemetra+, the proxy is used to
get time series from remote servers like .Stat.
