title: About JDemetra+ Reference Manual
layout: left-menu
---

The *Reference Manual* aims to guide the user through
the main features of JDemetra+ and to assist the user in taking
advantage of this powerful tool. The *Reference Manual*
presents an overview of the capabilities of the software and
includes detailed documentation on all of the specifications, with
discussions of the available arguments and their default values. Also,
the results displayed by JDemetra+ are explored in detail. For a short introduction to JDemetra+ software the user 
should refer to the [Quick Start](../quick-start/) section. A step-by-step
descriptions on how to perform a typical analysis with useful tips that
facilitate the replication of the results with the user's own data and
working instructions are all included in the [Case Studies](../case-studies) section.

JDemetra+ uses the notation "X12", "X13","Arima", "RegArima", "Tramo",
"Seats" and "TramoSeats" instead of "X-12-ARIMA", "X-13ARIMA-SEATS",
"ARIMA", "RegARIMA", "TRAMO", "SEATS" and "TRAMO-SEATS" respectively.
This notation is used in this page only when the references are made to the user interface.

### Users for whom the *Reference Manual* is intended {#users-to-whom-this-document-is-intended}

The *Reference Manual* provides information useful for beginners, i.e.
those who have only basic knowledge of seasonality and
its estimation in time series, and also for users who have already
acquired some experience with seasonal adjustment, i.e. those already using seasonal adjustment
software and interpreting the results at a basic
level.

The *Reference Manual* does not describe the detailed workings of the seasonal
adjustment methods, nor the underlying mathematics. It assumes that the
reader has acquired a background knowledge of the concepts underpinning seasonal
adjustment and is familiar with the X-12-ARIMA, the X-13ARIMA-SEATS and
the TRAMO-SEATS methods. A brief outline of the X-12-ARIMA, the
X-13ARIMA-SEATS and the TRAMO-SEATS algorithms and concepts is included in the [Theory behind SA](../theory/) section.
For readers interested in studying these seasonal adjustment methods
further, a bibliography is provided [here](../references/).

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts, such as
*stochastic and* *deterministic processes,* *time series*,
*trend-cycle*, *seasonality*, *descriptive statistics*, *confidence
levels*, *mean square error*, *estimate*, *estimator*, *linear
regression, stationarity*, *ARIMA process* and so on. Readers with
insufficient background to follow this document are encouraged to reference
an appropriate time series textbook, e.g. CHATFIELD (2004).

### How the *Reference Manual* section is organised {#how-the-document-is-organised}

In the *Reference Manual* section the user will find:

- a detailed description of the main windows: [Data providers](../reference-manual/data-providers.html) and [Workspace](../reference-manual/workspace.html).
- an explanation of [calendars](../reference-manual/calendars.html) and [user-defined regression variables](../reference-manual/user-defined-variables.html).
- information on the options available in the [application menu](../reference-manual/application-menu.html).
- a presentation of the options for the [modelling specifications](../reference-manual/modelling.html) and [seasonal adjustment specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html).
- examples of the [results from the pre-defined and user-defined seasonal adjustment processes](../reference-manual/output.html).
