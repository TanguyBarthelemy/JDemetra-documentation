The current pages refer only to capabilities and functions of JDemetra+ versions 2.x.x. 
The latest releases and information on improvements and bug fixes can be obtained through [GitHub](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app/releases).

The current documentation is also available in a pdf format, which can be found on a [dedicated page](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/documentation_en) on the CROS portal. However, this format is not a subject to maintenance or updates.
