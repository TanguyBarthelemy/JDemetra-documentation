title: Identification of seasonal peaks in a Tukey periodogram and in an autoregressive spectrum
tagline: technical documentation for JDemetra+ using GitHub Pages
description: Basics
---

In order to decide whether a series has a seasonal component that is
predictable (stable) enough, these tests use visual criteria and formal
tests for the periodogram. The periodogram is calculated using complete
years, so that the set of Fourier frequencies contains exactly all
seasonal frequencies[^85].

The tests rely on two basic principles:

-   The peaks associated with seasonal frequencies should be larger than
    > the median spectrum for all frequencies and;

-   The peaks should exceed the spectrum of the two adjacent values by
    > more than a critical value.

> JDemetra+ performs this test on the original series. If these two

> and trading days frequencies depends on the frequency of time series.

The calendar (trading day or working day) effects, related to the
variation in the number of different days of the week per period, can
induce periodic patterns in the data that can be similar to those
resulting from pure seasonal effects. From the theoretical point of
view, trading day variability is mainly due to the fact that the average
number of days in the months or quarters is not equal to a multiple of
$7$ (the average number of days of a month in the year of $365.25\ $days
is equal to $\frac{365.25}{12} = 30.4375$ days). This effect occurs
$\frac{365.25}{12} \times \frac{1}{7} = 4.3482$ times per month: one
time for each one of the four complete weeks of each month, and a
residual of $0.3482$ cycles per month, i.e.
$0.3482 \times 2\pi = 2.1878\ radians$. This turns out to be a
fundamental frequency for the effects associated with monthly data. In
JDemetra+ the fundamental frequency corresponding to $0.3482$ cycles per
month is used in place of the closest frequency$\ \frac{\text{πk}}{60}$.
Thus, the quantity $\frac{\pi \times 42}{60}$ is replaced
by $$\omega_{42} = 0.3482 \times 2\pi = 2.1878$$. The frequencies
neighbouring $\omega_{42}$, i.e. $$\omega_{41}$$ and $$\omega_{43}$$ are set
to, respectively, $$2.1865 - \frac{1}{60}$$ and $$2.1865 + \frac{1}{60}$$.

The default frequencies ($d)\ $for calendar effect are: 2.188 (monthly
series) and 0.280 (quarterly series). They are computed as:

 $\omega_{\text{ce}} = \frac{2\pi}{7}\left( n - 7 \times \left\lbrack \frac{n}{7} \right\rbrack \right)$,   \[1\] <!---\[7.158\]      -->
where:
 
$n = \frac{365.25}{s}$, $s = 4$ for quarterly series and $s = 12$ for
monthly series.

Other frequencies that correspond to trading day frequencies are: 2.714
(monthly series) and 1.292, 1.850, 2.128 (quarterly series).

In particular, the calendar frequency in monthly data (marked in red on the figure below) is very close to the seasonal frequency corresponding to 4
cycles per year $\text{ω}_{40} = \frac{2}{3}\pi = 2.0944$.

This implies that it may be hard to disentangle both effects using the
frequency domain techniques.
