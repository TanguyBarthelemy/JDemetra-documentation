Revisions are calculated as differences between the first (earliest)
adjustment of an observation at time $t$, computed when this observation
is the last observation of the time series (*concurrent adjustment,*
denoted as $A_{t|t}$) and a later adjustment based on all future data
available at the time of the diagnostic analysis (*the* *most recent*
*adjustment,* denoted as $A_{t|N}$).

In the case of the multiplicative decomposition the revision history of
the seasonal adjustment from time $N_{0}\ $to $N_{1}$ is a sequence of
$R_{t|N}^{A}$ calculated in the following way :


  $$
  R_{t|N}^{A} = 100 \times \frac{A_{t|N} - A_{t|t}}{A_{t|t}}
  $$   \[1\] <!---\[7.126\]      -->
  

The revision history of the trend is computed in the same manner.

With an additive decomposition $R_{t|N}^{A}$ is calculated in the same
way if all values $A_{t|t}$ have the same sign. Otherwise differences
are calculated as:

 
  $$
  R_{t|N}^{A} = A_{t|N} - A_{t|t}
  $$   \[2\] <!---\[7.158\]      --> 
 

The analogous expression for the trend component is:


  $$
  R_{t|N}^{T} = T_{t|N} - T_{t|t}
  $$   \[3\] <!---\[7.128\]      -->


Revision in the period-to-period (month-on-month or quarter-to-quarter)
change in the seasonally adjusted series at time $t$ calculated from the
series $y_{1},y_{2},\ldots y_{n}$ is defined as:

  
  $$
  R_{t}^{A} = C_{t|N} - C_{t|t}
  $$   \[4\] <!---\[7.129\]      -->
 

where $$
\text{C}_{t|n}^{A} = \frac{A_{t|n} - A_{t - 1|n}}{A_{t - 1|n}}
$$.

Revisions for the period-to-period changes in the trend component are
computed in the same manner.
