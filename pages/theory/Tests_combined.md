This test combines the Kruskal-Wallis test along with test for the
presence of seasonality assuming stability ($F_{S}$), and evaluative
seasonality test for detecting the presence of identifiable seasonality
($F_{M}$). Those three tests are calculated using the final unmodified
SI component. The main purpose of the combined seasonality test is to
check whether the seasonality of the series is identifiable. For
example, the identification of the seasonal pattern is problematic if
the process is dominated by highly moving seasonality[^83]. The testing
procedure is shown in the figure below.
