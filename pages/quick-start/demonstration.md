For a detailed demonstration of the seasonal adjustment process, please refer to the [JDemetra+ Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYDyEqMSjZ8&t=) video developed by Andreea Mirica (Statistics Romania). For a step-by-step illustration of the key stages for seasonal adjustment, refer to the guidance below.

The default view of the JDemetra+ window, which is displayed after launching the program, is shown below.

**JDemetra+ default window**

By default, on the left hand side of the window two panels are visible: the [*Workspace* panel](../reference-manual/workspace.html) and the [*Providers* panel](../reference-manual/data-providers.html). 
The *Workspace* panel stores the work performed by the user in a coherent and structured way.
The *Providers* panel presents the list of the [data sources](../quick-start/datasources.html) and organizes the imported series within each data provider. 

## Importing the series

Once the spreadsheet is prepared as it is shown [here](../quick-start/datasources.html) and saved, 
it can be imported to JDemetra+ as it is shown in the video below.

**Importing the series**

The data are organized in a tree structure. If you expand all the 
plus-signs under the spreadsheet you will see all the series within each 
sheet that has been loaded. Here all time series are visible under the 
*Production in construction* branch. The names of time series have been 
taken from the columns’ headings of the spreadsheet while the names of 
the branches come from sheets’ names. 

## An automatic seasonal adjustment

To execute a seasonal adjustment process of given time series dataset go 
to the main menu and follow the path: **Statistical methods → Seasonal 
adjustment → Multi Processing → New**. This command opens an empty 
*SAProcessing* window. Next, drag and drop series in the *SAProcessing* 
window and launch the seasonal adjustment process. Explore the results 
and save them. The gif below shows the details of the actions performed in an automatic seasonal adjustment process.

## Manual interventions
The specifications used for seasonal adjustment of an individual series 
can be changed as shown in the presentation below. Be aware that the 
changes introduced in a given settings' section may lead to changes in 
the output for other parts of the results. The options for the pre-processing of the series are explained under [modelling specifications](../reference-manual/modelling-specifications.html)
and the options for the pure seasonal adjustment process are explained under [seasonal adjustment specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html).

## Output options
To export the results of seasonal adjustment for the whole dataset, 
select the *Output* item from the *SAProcessing* menu.

The procedure to extract the output is explained [here](../case-studies/output.html) in detail. The results can be 
exported to CSV, CVS matrix, TXT and XLS formats and the list of 
available items depends on the format choice. The CVS, TXT and XLS 
formats are used to save the results in a form of the time series. 
The CVS matrix is a format for saving various 
diagnostics and statistics. The list of available items is available 
[here](../theory/output.html).
