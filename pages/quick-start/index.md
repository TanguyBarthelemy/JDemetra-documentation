The *Quick Start* aims to introduce the JDemetra+ 2.2 software, which 
enables the user to perform seasonal adjustment and other operations. 
The *Quick Start* gives working instructions on how to 
install and launch the software. It includes a step-by-step description 
of how to perform the first analysis with JDemetra+. The dataset used in the *Quick Start* to 
illustrate the JDemetra+ functionalities is accessible 
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/content/dataset-jdemetra-quick-start_en/" target="_blank">here</a> and can 
be used to replicate the results presented in theis section. 

The *Quick Start* is intended for beginners, who have only a basic 
knowledge of seasonality and its estimation in time series. Therefore, 
the case study included in this document is a basic one. For decription of more advanced examples refer to the [*Case studies*](../case-studies/).
Information about the JDemetra+ software and its functionalities can be found in the 
[Reference Manual](../reference-manual/).

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with time series related 
concepts. Readers with insufficient background to follow this document 
are encouraged to refer to an appropriate textbook, e.g. CHATFIELD 
(2004). 

The *Quick Start* neither describes in detail how the seasonal 
adjustment methods work, nor the underlying mathematics. For the 
readers interested in studying seasonal adjustment methods [brief 
sketches of the X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO-SEATS algorithms and concepts](../theory/) 
as well as a [bibliography](../references/) are included in this Wiki.
