A composite calendar is an option which is useful for series that
include data from more than one country/region. This option can be
used, for example, to create the calendar for the European Union or to
create the national calendar for a country, in which regional holidays
are celebrated. For example, in Germany public holidays are determined
by the [federal states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany).
For example, Epiphany is celebrated only in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and
in Saxony-Anhalt, while from 1994 the [Day of Repentance and
Prayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_Bededag#Bu.C3.9F-_und_Bettag_in_Germany)
is celebrated only in Saxony.

1.  To create a composite calendar, create first the calendars for each member
    state/region by using the [*National calendar*](../case-studies/calendars-national.html) option. The picture below shows a list of calendars that describe
    each of the sixteen German federal states.

3.  Fill the name box and mark the regional calendars that will be used
    to create a composite calendar. Assign a weight to each calendar.
    This weight should indicate the share of a given item in the total
    value that will be analysed using the composite calendar. In the
    strict sense, these weights differ between investigated series as
    well as over time. For practical reasons one might consider, for
    example, the composite calendar on a pro rata basis dependent on the
    share of employees in the federal states. The
    weights in the example below are chosen arbitrarily. After setting
    the weights, click *OK* to save the calendar.

4.  The newly created calendar is visible on the list. It can be edited,
    cloned, exported or removed. These options are available from the
    local menu (right-click).
