*Automatic seasonal adjustment* scenarios are intended for users who do not
have much practical experience in seasonal adjustment. They show how to
define a seasonal adjustment process, generate results swiftly, correct
the specification for the most severe shortcomings (if any) and export
the results. These instructions describe how to obtain satisfactory results 
in a reasonably short time. This section is also useful
for experienced users dealing with large datasets. Two paths are
available here: [*simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-single.html)
and [*simple seasonal adjustment of multiple time series*](../case-studies/simplesa-muliple.html).
