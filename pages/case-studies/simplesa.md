*Automatic seasonal adjustment* scenarios are intended for users who do not
have much practical experience in seasonal adjustment. They show how to
define a seasonal adjustment process, generate results swiftly, correct
the specification for the most severe shortcomings (if any) and export
the results. These instructions describe how to obtain results of
satisfactory quality and in a reasonably short time. This is also useful
for experienced users dealing with large datasets. Two paths are
available here: *simple seasonal adjustment of a single time series* and
*simple seasonal adjustment of multiple time series*.
