This scenario guides the user through all the steps involved in the
process of seasonally adjusting a single time series. Links to the
appropriate parts of the *Reference Manual* for
detailed explanations of actions to be performed are provided when
necessary.

1.  Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* →
    *Seasonal adjustment* → *Single analysis*. Select a seasonal
    adjustment method (*TramoSeats* (i.e. the TRAMO/SEATS method will be
    used) or *X13* (i.e. the X13ARIMA-SEATS will be used).

	**Launching seasonal adjustment for a single time series**

2.  An empty panel will be opened. The picture below shows the view when the X-13ARIMA-SEATS method is chosen.

	**Single analysis window**

3.  Select a data provider and unfold an already imported dataset. Drag
    and drop one time series from the *Providers* window to the *Drop
    data here* box as shown below. The window contains two panels. The
    one on the left presents the structure of the output in a form of an
    output tree. The other one is empty. Once seasonal adjustment has
    been performed, this panel will show detailed results for any item
    chosen by the user from the output tree.

	**Starting a seasonal adjustment process**

4.  When the user drops a series into the document window (X13Doc in the
    example presented in this scenario) JDemetra+ starts the seasonal
    adjustment process automatically. By default, a summary of results
    is displayed. It is accompanied with two graphs: an overlay graph on the left with the original unadjusted series,
    the seasonally-adjusted series and the trend-cycle and the *SI
    ratio* graph on the right. The diagnostics and graphs for the modelling part are discussed [here](../reference-manual/output-modelling.html)
    The user can find also find some explanations of the [results of seasonal adjustment for X-13ARIMA-SEATS]..(/reference-manual/sa-output-X13.html) and for [TRAMO/SEATS](../reference-manual/sa-output-tramo.html)). 
	The *Main
    results* panel provides a first impression of the quality of the
    adjustment. Study the diagnostics section using the vertical
    scrollbar.

	**Simple seasonal adjustment, single time series: main results panel**

5.  The results are in green, yellow or red text, depending on the
    result of the statistical test. The results are
    marked in green, yellow or red, depending on the result of the
    statistical test used. Green indicates that problematic
    characteristics have not been detected (e.g. lack of normality of
    residuals, the autocorrelation in residuals). Yellow
    indicates that the test outcome is uncertain. Those in red indicate that there are issues that should be addressed. 
	The user is expected to investigate the problematic test statistics and try to improve the
    model, so that no uncertain or rejected test results are present.

	**Diagnostic results - simple seasonal adjustment of single time series**

6.  To explore the results, expand the tree in the left panel and click
    on the desired node. Here [*Out-of-sample test*](../reference-manual/forecasts.html) was chosen.

	**Exploring the results**

7.  The default specification used for a seasonal adjustment can be
    modified by clicking on the *Specifications* button.

	**Changing a default specification**

8.  The *Specifications* panel presents settings that have been used to
    generate the current output.

	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

	**Specification panel**

9.  To change a given setting, click on it and choose an option from the
    list and/or enter a value. In the picture below the series span was
    shortened by the first 12 observations. Inputs in green indicate that
    the entered values are acceptable (appropriate format, data within
    the allowed range and so on). To apply the changes
    click on the *Apply* button in the bottom part of the window.

	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

	{: .text-center.small}

	**Modifying settings**

10. Be aware that the changes introduced may lead to changes in the
    output for other parts of the results. The example below illustrates
    that omitting the first 12 observations results in automatic
    detection of trading day effects and the Easter effect, which
    were not present in the previous model.

	**The effect of applying modified settings**

11. To copy the estimated series (seasonally adjusted, trend, seasonal
    and irregular) to another file go to the *Table* item in the *Main
    results* section of the output tree. Then click on the upper-left
    cell in the table.

	{: .text-center.small}

	**Highlighting the output series**

12. Copy the series by clicking the *Copy* item from the context menu or
    use the standard *Ctrl+C* keys. Other options from this menu are
    explained [here](../reference-manual/input.html).

	**Copying the series**

13. Paste the series to the destination file (e.g. TXT, Excel).

	{: .text-center.small}

	**Easy exporting data to an Excel file**

14. To save the document created in JDemetra+ (named *X13Doc-1* in our
    example) select *Save Workspace As...* item from the *File* menu.

	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

	**Saving a workspace**

15. Enter the location, workspace name and click *Save.*

	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

	![Text](/assets/img/user-guide/UG_SSA_image15.jpg)

	{: .text-center.small}

	**Choosing a destination folder**

16. The document is visible in the *Workspace* window under the
    appropriate section (*x13* in the case presented in the picture).
    The document can be opened, deleted or renamed from the context
    menu.

	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

	{: .text-center.small}

	**The content of the context menu for a single document**

17. The user can also add comments to the document. To display the
    comments and modify them, click on *Edit comments* from the context
    menu.

	{: .text-center.image-wrapper}

	![Text](/assets/img/user-guide/UG_SSA_image17.jpg)

	{: .text-center.small}

	**An example of an *Edit comments* window**

18. At the end of this process,
    the user is presented with the results already saved in the
    workspace. The option *Refresh data* becomes active when the given
    workspace is opened again. This option can be activated either from
    a local menu or from the main menu. Once it is activated, JDemetra+
    refers to the data source defined in the workspace and uses this
    current version of data to perform seasonal adjustment with the settings saved in
    the document.
