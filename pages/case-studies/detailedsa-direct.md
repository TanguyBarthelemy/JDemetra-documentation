Economic time series are often computed and reported according to a
certain classification or a breakdown. For example, in National Accounts
total consumption expenditures are a sum of individual consumption
expenditures and General Government & NPISHs consumption expenditures.
Therefore, the seasonally adjusted aggregates can be computed either by
aggregating the seasonally adjusted components (indirect adjustment) or
adjusting the aggregate and the components independently (direct
adjustment). The point is that these two strategies result in different
seasonally adjusted aggregates. As neither theoretical nor empirical
evidence uniformly favours one approach over the other, the choice of
the seasonal adjustment strategy concerning aggregated series depends on
the user[^2]. Guidance in this field is given in the
[ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment (2015)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/6830795/KS-GQ-15-001-EN-N.pdf/d8f1e5f5-251b-4a69-93e3-079031b74bd3)

1.  JDemetra+ offers a *Direct--Indirect Seasonal Adjustment*
    functionality that facilitates the comparison of the results from
    these two strategies, which is launched from the main menu.

2.  To start the analysis drag and drop time series to the top-left
    panel. The panel on the right presents the sum of selected series.

3.  By going to the main menu and clicking on *Window* â†’ *Properties*,
    one can specify benchmarking options for direct-indirect comparison.
    Be aware that the properties window displays the properties of an
    active item. Therefore, first click on the time series graph in the
    picture below and then activate the *Properties* window.

4.  By default, the [pre-defined TRAMO-SEATS specification](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#pre-defined-specifications) is used
    (RSAfull) for seasonal adjustment of a dataset. To change it, click on
    the button marked in the picture below. This will provide you with
    the alternative specifications. Here the user defined specification
    named *My spec* is chosen.

5.  Next, run the process by clicking the button with the green arrow.

	**Running a process**

6.  The bottom panel presents the detailed results. The seasonality test
    node presents the outcome of the [seasonality tests](../theory/Tests_seas.html)
    performed for the aggregated series adjusted directly (*Direct sa*)
    and indirectly (*Indirect sa*). The reason for presenting these
    tests here is that the presence of residual seasonality and calendar
    effects should be monitored, especially in the indirectly adjusted
    series[^3]. It might happen that the seasonality is successfully
    removed from the components but it is still present in the
    aggregated series.

	**Seasonality tests' results for a direct seasonal adjustment**

7.  The *Differences* node presents selected different results between the
    direct and the indirect seasonal adjustment approaches. The *Statistics*
    section shows basic statistics (average, standard deviation, minimum
    and maximum) for the relative differences (%) between the direct and
    the indirect SA series. *Chart* contains the graph of the
    differences, while *Table* includes the actual values. The
    *Periodogram* section presents graphs for two spectral estimators --
    [the periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html) and [the auto-regressive spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html).

8.  The *Details* node include the basic statistics for the relative
    differences between the benchmarked and original series as well as the actual
    time series adjusted directly (*Sa series*) and indirectly
    (*Benchmarked Sa series*).
