This scenario is designed for advanced users interested in an in-depth analysis of
time series in the frequency domain using three spectral graphs. Those
graphs can also be used as a complementary analysis for a better
understanding of the results obtained with some of the tests described
above.

Economic time series are usually presented in a time domain (X-axis).
However, for analytical purposes it is convenient to convert the
series to a frequency domain due to the fact that any stationary time
series can be expressed as a combination of cosine (or sine) functions.
These functions are characterized with different periods (amount of time
to complete a full cycle) and amplitudes (maximum/minimum value during
the cycle).

The tool used for the analysis of a time series in a frequency domain is
called a spectrum. The peaks in the spectrum indicate the presence of
cyclical movements with periodicity between two months and one year. A seasonal
series should have peaks at the seasonal
frequencies. Calendar adjusted data are not expected to have peak at with a
calendar frequency.

The periodicity of the phenomenon at frequency *f* is $\frac{2\pi}{f}$. It
means that for a monthly time series the seasonal frequencies
$\frac{\pi}{6},\ \frac{\pi}{3},\ \frac{\pi}{2},\ \frac{2\pi}{3},\ \frac{5\pi}{6}\ $
and $\pi$ correspond to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles per year. For
example, the frequency $\frac{\pi}{3}$ corresponds to a periodicity of 6
months (2 cycles per year are completed). For the quarterly series there
are two seasonal frequencies: $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (one cycle per year) and
$\pi$ (two cycles per year). A peak at the zero frequency always
corresponds to the trend component of the series. Seasonal frequencies
are marked as grey vertical lines, while violet vertical lines represent the
trading-days frequencies. The trading day frequency is 0.348 and derives
from the fact that a daily component which repeats every seven days goes
through 4.348 cycles in a month of average length 30.4375 days. It is
therefore seen to advance 0.348 cycles per month when the data are
obtained at twelve equally spaced times in 365.25 days (the average
length of a year).

The interpretation of the spectral graph is rather straightforward. When
the values of a spectral graph for low frequencies (i.e. one year and
more) are large in relation to its other values it means that the
long-term movements dominate in the series. When the values of a
spectral graph for high frequencies (i.e. below one year) are large in
relation to its other values it means that the series are rather
trendless and contains a lot of noise. When the values of a spectral
graph are distributed randomly around a constant without any visible
peaks, then it is highly probable that the series is a random process.
The presence of seasonality in a time series is manifested in a spectral
graph by the peaks on the seasonal frequencies.

**Auto-regressive spectrum's properties**


1. The spectral graphs are available from: *Tools* → *Spectral

2. When the first option is chosen JDemetra+ displays an empty
    *Auto-regressive spectrum* window. To start an analysis drag a
    single time series from the *Providers* window and drop it into the
    *Drop data here* area.

	**Launching an auto-regressive spectrum**
	
3. An auto-regressive spectrum graph available in JDemetra+ is based on the relevant tool from the X-13ARIMA-SEATS program. It shows the
    spectral density (spectrum) function, which reformulates the content
    of the stationary time series' autocovariances in terms of
    amplitudes at frequencies of half a cycle per month or less. The
    number of observations, data transformations and other options such
    as the specification of the frequency grid and the order of the
    autoregressive polynomial (30 by default) can be specified by opening
    the *Window* → *Properties* from the main menu.
	
 
	The *Auto-regressive - Properties* window contains the following options:

	-   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series;

	-   **Differencing** - transforms a data by calculating a regular (order
		1,2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time series
		frequency) differences;

	-   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that the program will use
		to take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then
		the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag (default)
		but to the third lag.

	-   **Last years** - a number of years at the end of the time series
		taken to produce autoregresive spectrum. By default, it is 0, which
		means that the whole time series is considered.

	-   **Auto-regressive polynomial order** - the number of lags in the AR
		model that is used to estimate the spectral density. By default, the
		order of the autoregressive polynomial is set to 30 lags.

	-   **Resolution** - the value 1 plots the spectral density estimate for
		the frequencies $\omega_{j} = \frac{2\pi j}{n}$, where
		$n \in ( - \pi;\pi)$ is the size of the sample used to estimate the
		AR model. Increasing this value, which is set to 5 by default, will
		increase the precision of this grid.

4. The seasonality test described above uses an empirical criterion to
    check whether the series has a seasonal component that is
    predictable (stable) enough that it can be estimated with reasonable
    success. The peak in the [auto-regressive spectrum](../theory/spectral_AR.html) 
	has to be greater than the median of the 61 spectrum
    ordinates and has to exceed the two adjacent spectral values by more
    than a critical value. When such a case is detected, the test
    results are displayed in green.

5. The second spectral graph is a periodogram. To perform the analysis 
of a single time series using this tool, choose *Tools* →*Spectral 
analysis* → *Periodogram* and drag and drop a series from the 
*Providers* window to the empty *Periodogram* window.

6. The sample size and data transformations can be specified by opening the *Window* → *Properties*, in the main menu. The *Periodogram - Properties* window contains the following options:

	-   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series;

	-   **Differencing** - transforms the data by calculating regular (order 1,2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time series frequency) differences;

	-   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that you will use to take differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then the differencing filter does not apply to the first lag (default) but to the third lag.

	-   **Last years** - the number of years at the end of the time series taken to produce periodogram. By default it is 0, which means that the whole time series is considered.

	**Periodogram's properties**

7.  The [periodogram](../theory/spectral_periodogram.html) was one of the earliest tools used for the analysis
    of time series in the frequency domain. It enables the user to
    identify the dominant periods (or frequencies) of a time series.
    In general, the periodogram is a wildly fluctuating estimate of
    the spectrum with a high variance and is less stable than an
    auto-regressive spectrum.

8.  The third spectral graph is the Tukey spectrum. To perform the
    analysis of time series using this tool, choose *Tools* → *Spectral
    analysis* → *Tukey spectrum* and drag and drop a single series from
    the *Providers* window to the empty *Periodogram* window*.*

10. The options for the Tuckey window can be specified by opening the
    *Window* → *Properties* from the main menu. The *Periodogram -
    Properties* window contains the following options:

	-   **Log** - a log transformation of a time series.

	-   **Differencing** - transforms the data by calculating regular (order 1,
		 2..) or seasonal (order 4, 12, depending on the time series
		frequency) differences.

	-   **Differencing lag** - the number of lags that you will use to take
		differences. For example, if *Differencing lag = 3* then the
		differencing filter does not apply to the first lag (default) but
		to the third lag.

	-   **Taper part** -- parameter larger than 0 and smaller or equal to one
		that shapes the curvature of the smoothing function that is
		applied to the auto-covariance function.

	-   **Window length** -- the size of the window that is used to smooth the
		auto-covariance function. A value of zero includes the whole
		series.

	-   **Window type** -- it refers to the weighting scheme that it is used
		to smooth the auto-covariance function. The available windows
		types (*Square*, *Welch*, *Tukey*, *Barlett*, *Hamming*, *Parzen*)
		are suitable to estimate the spectral density.
