The saved results from a seasonal adjustment multi-process can be
refreshed when new or modified observations are available. JDemetra+
offers several options for refreshing the output, which are in line with
the *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015) requirements.

1.  To refresh the results open a previously saved workspace using the
    path *File* → *Open Workspace*. Choose the multi-document option from the
    [*Workspace* window](../reference-manual/workspace.html) and double click on it to display the
    multi-document menu (*SAProcessing*).

##### **Partial concurrent adjustment**

According to the *ESS Guidelines on Seasonal Adjustment* (2015), partial
concurrent adjustment is the strategy in which the model, filters,
outliers and calendar regressors are re-identified once a year and the
respective parameters and factors re-estimated every time new or
revised data become available. JDemetra+ offers several types of partial
concurrent adjustment.
