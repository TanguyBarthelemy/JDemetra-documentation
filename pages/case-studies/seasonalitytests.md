Seasonality tests play a fundamental role at different stages of the
automatic model identification process used by TRAMO-SEATS. They are
also crucial in the assessment of the results produced by
X-13-ARIMA-SEATS. When X-13-ARIMA-SEATS is used, the seasonal component are
estimated regardless of the properties of the original time series.
Therefore the user is expected to decide if seasonality is (or is not) present
in the time series.

The scenario presented here helps to identify seasonal movements in the
original time series using various tests available in JDemetra+. Its
purpose is to check for the presence of seasonal movements in the time
series and decide whether it should be adjusted for them or not. Some
explanations on the seasonality tests can be found [here](../theory/Tests_seas.html).

Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* →
*Seasonal Adjustment* → *Tools* → *Seasonality tests*.

**Opening a *Seasonality test* window**

1.  JDemetra+ opens a *Seasonality tests* window. It contains two empty
    panels. Once an analysis of a time series has been performed, the
    upper one will show a time series graph and the lower one will
    present detailed results for seasonality tests.

2.  To start the analysis, drag and drop one time series from the
    *Providers* window to the *Drop data here* area as shown below.

	**Launching the functionality**

3.  The testing process starts automatically. The upper panel displays
    a time series graph of the unadjusted data. Hovering over an observation with the
    mouse displays its value and date.

4.  Using the local menu the user may adjust the view of the picture,
    save it and/or save it to a set location (for details see 2.1.3).

	**Local menu basic options for the time series graph**

5.  By going to the main menu and choosing a path *Window* →
    *Properties*, one can re-run the tests with the alternative data
    transformations (logging and/or differencing) and a different sample
    size (option *last years*). When the option *Last years* is set to
    zero, the tests will be executed using all available observations.
    Be aware that the properties window displays the properties of an
    active item. Therefore, click on the time series graph in the
    picture below to display the properties correctly.

	***Seasonality tests* options**

6.  The diagnostic section in the bottom part of the window contains a
    summary table and detailed results for six seasonality tests. Study
    this section using the vertical scrollbar. The results are marked in
    green, yellow or red, depending on the result of statistical test
    used. In general, an outcome that appears in JDemetra+ interface in
    green indicates no evidence of a problem in a tested area, yellow is
    uncertain and red indicates an issue that should be addressed. In
    this scenario the results in green indicate that the given test detected
    seasonal movements. For tests where p-values are
    given, green denotes that the desired test result was achieved at
    the 5% confidence level. An outcome in yellow means that the
    relevant test statistics can be accepted at the 1% level. An outcome
    in red denotes that the test statistic was rejected.

7.  The test on autocorrelation on seasonal lags is the Ljung-Box test.
    It checks the correlation between the actual observation and
    observation lagged by one and two years. In the case of a monthly
    time series the autocorrelation between these values is denoted as
    ac(12) and ac(24) respectively. In case of a quarterly time series
    the autocorrelation between these values is denoted as ac(4) and
    ac(8) respectively. If the observations are independent from each
    other, they follow a $\chi^{2}$ distribution. When this hypothesis is
    rejected, a significant autocorrelation is confirmed, which is a
    sign of seasonal movements in the series and the test's outcome is
    displayed in green.

8.  The Friedman test is a non-parametric method for testing that
    samples are drawn from the same population or from populations with
    equal medians. In the regression equation the significance of the
    month (or quarter) effect is tested. The Friedman test requires no
    distributional assumptions. It uses the rankings of the
    observations. If the null hypothesis of no stable seasonality is
    rejected at the 0.1% significance level, $p Value < 0.001$, then the
    series is considered to be seasonal and the test's outcome is
    displayed in green.

9.  The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test used for comparing
    samples from two or more groups. The null hypothesis states that all
    months (or quarters, respectively) have the same mean. Under this
    hypothesis the test statistic follows a $\chi^{2}\ $distribution.
    When this hypothesis is rejected, it is assumed that time series
    values differ significantly between periods and the test's results
    are displayed in green.

10. The identification of seasonal peaks can also be carried out with
    the auto-regressive spectrum and Tukey periodogram. The
    autoregressive spectrum is based on the estimation of an AR(30)
    process, while the Tukey periodogram is a non-parametric estimator
    that introduces some degree of smoothing in the periodogram. In
    order to decide whether the series has a seasonal component that
    is predictable (stable) enough the tests use visual criteria and
    formal tests that rely on two basic principles: 
	a) the peaks associated to seasonal frequencies should be larger than the median
    spectrum for all frequencies and 
	b) the peaks should exceed the spectrum of the two adjacent values by more than a critical value.
    When these principes are met, the test results are displayed in green.
    The statistical significance of each one of the seasonal peaks (i.e.
    frequencies
    $\frac{\pi}{6},\ \frac{\pi}{3},\ \frac{\pi}{2},\ \frac{2\pi}{3},\ \frac{5\pi}{6}\text{ }$and
    $\pi$ corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cycles per year) are also
    displayed.

11. The auto-regressive spectrum test is a test that originates from the
    X-13ARIMA-SEATS program. It is based on the spectral density
    (spectrum) function, which reformulates the content of the
    stationary time series' autocovariances in terms of amplitudes at
    frequencies of half a cycle per month or less. Due to the possibly
    evolving nature of the seasonal movements the interval for spectrum
    estimation is the 96 most recent observations. The test checks if
    the series has a seasonal component that is predictable (stable)
    enough so that X-13ARIMA-SEATS can estimate it with reasonable
    success. When such a case is detected, the test's result is
    displayed in green. This test is available only for monthly data. In
    case of quarterly time series it is not displayed.

12. As opposed to the empirical criteria described in the previous
    point, one can use a formal test to assess the statistical
    significance of the periodogram's peaks at seasonal frequencies. The
    test proposed is based on the sum of the values of the periodogram
    at seasonal frequencies, which follows a $\chi^{2}$(24) distribution under the
    null hypothesis of an absence of seasonality.

13. Finally, a test on a regression with seasonal dummies checks the
    presence of deterministic seasonality. The first version of the test
    uses seasonal dummies (mean effect and 11 dummies for monthly
    data, or 3 dummies for quarterly data) in a RegARIMA model, in
    which the ARIMA part of the model is (0,1,1)(0,0,0). The
    test statistics checks if the seasonal dummies are jointly
    statistically insignificant. When this hypothesis is rejected, it is
    assumed that the deterministic seasonality is present and the test's
    results are displayed in green.

	**Tests on regression with the fixed seasonal dummies**

14. In the second version of this test the regression is performed on an
    automatically identified ARIMA model instead of ARIMA
    (0,1,1)(0,0,0). The test statistics checks if the seasonal dummies
    are jointly statistically insignificant. 
    When this hypothesis is rejected, it is assumed that
    deterministic seasonality is present and the test's results are
    displayed in green.
