This document aims to introduce users to the main features of JDemetra+
enabling them to take advantage of this program and understand the
output from the sequential steps in the analysis. The document includes
step-by-step descriptions of how to perform a typical analysis and
useful tips that facilitate replication of the results with the user’s own
data and working instructions. The *Case Studies* section does not cover
all available JDemetra+ functionalities. These are included in the
[*Reference Manual*](../reference-manual/) and the user should refer to it for
additional information.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts, such as *time
series*, *trend-cycle*, *seasonality*, *descriptive statistics*,
*confidence levels*, *mean square error*, *estimate*, *estimator*,
*linear regression, stationarity*, *ARIMA process* and so on. Readers
with insufficient background to follow this document are encouraged to
refer to an appropriate textbook, e.g. Chatfield (2004).

JDemetra+ uses the notation "X12", "X13","Arima", "RegArima" and
"TramoSeats" instead of "X-12-ARIMA", "X-13ARIMA-SEATS", "ARIMA",
"RegARIMA" and "TRAMO-SEATS" respectively. This notation is also used in
the *Case Studies* when references to the user interface are
made.

### Who should use this document? {#who-should-use-this-document}

With JDemetra+, which is an extremely user-friendly software,
pre-adjustment and decomposition of a time series can be performed
easily by users who have absolutely no knowledge of seasonal adjustment
theory. Although the output is easy to produce, its analysis,
interpretation, readjustment and validation requires certain knowledge
and experience. Therefore the *JDemetra+ User Guide* is designed for two
types of users: beginners, who have only a basic knowledge of
seasonality and its estimation in time series, and advanced users, who
already perform seasonal adjustment and are able to interpret the
outcomes, at least at a basic level.

*Case Studies* section neither describes in detail how the seasonal
adjustment methods work, nor the underlying mathematics. For
readers interested in seasonal adjustment methods a brief
sketch of the X-13ARIMA-SEATS and TRAMO-SEATS algorithms and concepts
are included in the [*Reference Manual*](../reference-manual/). 
For those interested in a more detailed discussion of seasonal adjustment you are encouraged to refer to the [References] section(../references).

### How the document is organized {#how-the-document-is-organized}

The *Case Studies* section includes a set of scenarios. They focus on various topics, such as:
 - [Simple](../case-studies/modelling-basic.html) and [advanced](../case-studies/modelling-advanced.html) time series modelling
 - [Automatic seasonal adjustment process](../case-studies/simplesa.html)
 - [Manual setting of the parameters of the seasonal adjustment process](../case-studies/specification.html)
 - [Generating the output from the seasonal adjustment procedure](../case-studies/output.html)
 - Options for the [revision policies](../case-studies/revision.html)
 - Setting the [calendars](../case-studies/calendars-main.html)
 - Tools for [spectral graphs](../case-studies/spectralgraphs.html)
 

### How to use this document {#how-to-use-this-document}

With JDemetra+ seasonal adjustment can be performed in several ways.
Additional functionalities designed for time series analysis, not
necessarily strictly related to seasonal adjustment, are also provided.

The *Case Studies* section offers several typical paths that can be
followed to perform analyses in an efficient way. The scenarios are
designed to account for different user aims as well as common constraints, such
as the time allocated to perform the task, the size of the dataset and
the user’s experience and skill in seasonal adjustment. Each scenario
includes sequential phases of the analysis, e.g. preparing the source data,
analysis of the results, readjustment of the parameters and regular data
production. Therefore, it is recommended to study each scenario from the
beginning to the end.
 
The scenarios on seasonal adjustment consist of [two simple scenarios](../case-studies/simplesa.html)
for beginners and users with limited
time for performing seasonal adjustment and [several scenarios of more
detailed seasonal adjustment](../case-studies/detailedsa.html) for experienced users. The simple and
detailed scenarios include examples of single time
series and multiple time series analysis.

There are [two time series modelling scenarios](../case-studies/modelling-main.html), 
one [basic](../case-studies/modelling-basic.html) and one [advanced](../case-studies/modelling-basic.html)
that provide examples of the analysis time characteristics. The
scenario for advanced users provides a more detailed analysis that includes
identification and estimation of outliers, calendar effects,
interpolation of missing values and forecasting. The basic scenario is a
limited version of the advanced analysis, focused mostly on automatic
detection of outliers and calendar effects.

A [scenario on seasonality tests](../case-studies/seasonalitytests.html) 
is for all types of users and explains
how to test for the presence of seasonal movements in time series. The
presence of seasonality should be checked for each time series in a
dataset. The tests for seasonality are integral to the seasonal
adjustment procedures available in JDemetra+. However, the tests can also be
run independently of seasonal adjustment. The scenario on seasonality
tests serves this purpose. As it is designed for analysis of a single
time series, it is usually run as part of the detailed analysis of the most
important series. For example, it can be used for checking the presence
of seasonal movements to decide if a series should be seasonally
adjusted or for regular monitoring of seasonality in time series.

The [spectral graphs scenario](../case-studies/spectralgraphs.html) is for advanced users and introduces
an in-depth analysis of a time series in the frequency domain.

The [calendars scenarios](../case-studies/calendars-main.html) explain how to define country-specific holidays
and include them into a national calendar. They also deal with more
sophisticated types of calendars and explain how to import them.
