title: Simple seasonal adjustment of multiple time series
tagline: technical documentation for JDemetra+ using GitHub Pages
description: Basics
---
This scenario is intended for the seasonal adjustment of a dataset with
multiple time series. It is especially useful when hundreds of series
need to be processed and the quality of their adjustment assessed. This
scenario can be used in a regular production process. As it does not
focus on individual series, it is not recommended for the adjustment of
key indicators that requires a detailed analysis of the results and possible refining
of the seasonal adjustment settings. The scenario shows the steps of the
data generating process for multiple series, with references to the
appropriate sections of the *Reference Manual* for more
detailed explanations. Although this case study is intended for
datasets with multiple time series, it can be also performed for a single time series, provided
that the analysis is done in a multi-document.

1.  Go to the main menu and follow the path: *Statistical methods* →
    *Seasonal adjustment* → *Multi Processing* → *New* to open a
    multi-document.

	**Launching the seasonal adjustment for a
datasets with multiple time series**

2.  JDemetra+ opens an empty window (default name: *SAProcessing-1*). By
    default, one of the [pre-defined specifications](../reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#pre-defined-specifications)
	will be used for the seasonal
    adjustment of the dataset. To change the specification used for an
    adjustment in the current document, click on the button marked in
    the picture below. This will provide you with the alternative
    methods of adjustment.

	**Default window for seasonal adjustment process of the dataset**

3.  The list available from the *SAProcessing* window includes the
    pre-defined specifications and the [user-defined specifications](/reference-manual/sa-specifications.html#user-defined-specifications) (if
    any). Click on the specification that will be used for the
    seasonal adjustment (in the example below *RSA4* is selected).

	**Choice of the specification**

4.  Drag and drop series from the *Providers* window to the
    *SAProcessing* window. You can drag and drop individual series or an
    entire dataset (i.e. a set of series that have been imported
    together, e.g. series from the same Excel file). It is possible to
    drag and drop the same series several times. It allows the user to
    apply different specifications to the same time series in order to
    compare the results. The series visible in the *SAProcessing* window
    are not seasonally adjusted yet (*Status* -- \"Unprocessed\").
    The adjustment will be performed using *RSA4* specification. For a newly
    created *SAProcessing* window the *Estimation* column is always set
    to *Concurrent*, which means that previous results for these time
    series will not be taken into account once this seasonal adjustment
    is launched (as they do not exist). However, a seasonal adjustment
    processing window may be saved and re-launched in the next session
    of JDemetra+. Then the user can decide [if and how the previous
    results will be taken into account in the current session]((../case-studies/revision.html)). At this stage the
    *Priority*, *Quality* and *Warnings* columns are empty as seasonal
    adjustment has not yet been performed.

	**Adding the series to the multi document**

5.  Once the user clicks on the start button (the button with a green
    arrow) the time series are processed, the statuses are updated and
    some information about the quality of the adjustments and possible
    problems are displayed in the *Warnings* column as exclamation
    marks.

	**The *Start* button**

6.  Generally, the warnings are put forward for short series,
    non-decomposable models (SEATS) or when the differenced series do
    not show seasonal peaks. Information on the warnings is displayed
    when the cursor hovers over an exclamation mark.

	**The results of a seasonal adjustment process**

7.  When the user clicks on an individual time series in the
    *SAProcessing* window, detailed results are displayed in the panel
    below the list of the series. By default, a summary of results is
    displayed, accompanied by two graphs: an overlay graph on the left with the original data,
    seasonally-adjusted series and the trend-cycle and the SI
    ratio graph on the right. These diagnostics and graphs are
    discussed [here](../reference-manual/output.html).

	**The inspection of the seasonal adjustment results for a chosen time series**

8.  The *Main results* panel provides information on the quality of the
    adjustment. Study the diagnostic section using the vertical
    scrollbar. The results are marked in green, yellow or red, depending
    on the result of a statistical test used. Those in green indicate that
    no problematic characteristic have been detected (e.g. lack of
    normality of residuals, the autocorrelation in residuals). Yellow indicates that the test outcome is uncertain. The
    outcomes in red highlight cases where an issue should be addressed.
    Hence, test statistics will indicate the need (if any) to improve the model.
    Ideally, the model should be improved so that no test statistics
    indicate uncertainties in the results.

9.  To explore the results, expand the tree on the left and click on the
    desired node. Here the [*out-of-sample test*](../reference-manual/forecasts.html) was chosen.
