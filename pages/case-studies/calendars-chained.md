A chained calendar is an option that can be used when major changes in
the composition of the holidays take place. In such case two calendars
that describe the situation before and after the change of regime can be
defined. Poland experienced an introduction of new holidays in 1990.
This case can be captured by defining two calendars that include two
sets of holidays. The final Polish calendar is then defined as a chained
calendar by specifying in this case the two calendars and a break date.

1.  To create the chained calendar, first define two national calendars,
    following the [National calendars](../calendars-national.html) scenario. The two calendars will appear in the
    *Workspace* panel.
